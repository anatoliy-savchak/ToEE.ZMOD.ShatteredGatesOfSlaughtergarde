TAG_CO8				Circle of Eight Modpack Version 8.1.0 New Content Edition	Welcome!Some important notes:1.  Run as administrator if you're using Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8.2. Set your video card to a "no scaling" setting for video playback. This will make in-game videos play at their original resolution. Some systems experience game crashes when they try to scale ToEE's videos to fit the monitor.3. Do not use quicksaves with ToEE. They corrupt easily. Instead, use an array of at least 5 regular saves while playing ToEE, overwriting each in turn. This practice should ensure that you have a good save to go back to if one becomes corrupt.4. Do not save during combat. This also runs a greater risk of save corruption.5. Do not play in Ironman mode. Save corruption is a fact of life with ToEE, and if your Ironman save becomes corrupt, you're finished. If you want an Ironman-style game, it's best to simply play Ironman-style in a regular game.6. Do not use "autosave on map change" with ToEE. Using this feature will break certain scripts in ToEE. It is set to "off" by default in the Co8 modpack.7. Do not install the moebius2778 temple.dll independently. This file has been heavily modded since moebius2778's day at Co8, and the moebius fixes are included in the current version. If you overwrite the current version with the moebius version, you will be "undoing" a great many fixes. Do not install it separately.8. Do not put an NPC in the left-most position in the party queue along the bottom of the screen. This can cause a variety of problems, such as quests not updating properly or even appearing in your logbook at all.9. Do not use Scather or Fragarach in the Fire Node or the Fire Temple. You will likely experience the endless AoO loop, and you will be very sad.Many other common issues are answered in sticky threads at the Co8 site - www.co8.org.Enjoy the game!

TAG_NORMAL_GAME	TAG_INTERFACE_HELP			Normal Mode	The normal game allows you to reroll your character's ability points and load and save your game whenever you want. This is in contrast to the ~Ironman Mode~[TAG_IRONMAN] which gives you only one roll for your character's abilities and does not allow you to return to past saved games.
TAG_IRONMAN	TAG_INTERFACE_HELP			Ironman Mode	Ironman Mode is a special mode of the game where you are not allowed to ~Load and Save~[TAG_LOADSAVE] games, although you may Quick Save and Exit and Quick Load to return to the game. You are also not allowed to reroll your characters once you have selected them.
TAG_CHARGEN	TAG_INTERFACE_HELP			Character Generation 	Once you have selected a party alignment, you may begin character generation by selecting the blue character boxes at the bottom of the screen.First you roll for your ~ability~[TAG_ABILITIES] scores. If you don't like the outcome, you can reroll your scores. Once you find scores to your liking, you then click and drag them to the ability of your choice. Modifiers are shown as soon as you place the score.When done, you then select your ~Race~[TAG_RACES], ~Gender~[TAG_CHARGEN_GENDER], ~Height~[TAG_CHARGEN_HEIGHT], ~Hairstyle~[TAG_CHARGEN_HAIR], ~Class~[TAG_CLASSES], ~Alignment~[TAG_ALIGNMENT], and ~Deity~[TAG_RELIGION], as well as a ~portrait~[TAG_CHARGEN_PORTRAIT], ~voice~[TAG_CHARGEN_VOICE], and name for your character.You also select your class abilities (where applicable) of ~feats~[TAG_FEATS], ~skills~[TAG_SKILLS], and ~spells~[TAG_SPELLS] (if any) from the lists with available ones highlighted in white and class specific ones displayed in yellow.You must select all your skills, feats, and spells before moving on to the next category.After naming your character (the last step), you can then select FINISH and your character will be ready to begin adventuring.For more detailed information about each interface within Character Generation, please see ~Interface Help (Specific)~[TAG_HMU_ROOT], and scroll down to the PC Creation section.

TAG_HMU_ROOT	TAG_ROOT			Interface Help (Specific Interfaces)	[CMD_CHILDREN]
TAG_CHAR_ABILITIES_UI	TAG_DUMMY			Abilities UI	The interface specifically for your character or characters can be viewed by right-clicking on the character portrait displayed on the bottom of the game screen. In the middle of the interface, you will see a large box with a series of tabs lining the top. The last tab on the right, the one that features a figure with arms spread open, is the Abilities tab. Hovering over the tab itself with your mouse will produce a description of Abilities and then clicking on the tab will open that part of the interface. Here, you will see the following list:Kill Count: the number of enemies that the character has killedDeath Count: the number of times the character has diedCharacter Generation Method (# of Rolls)Mode (will read either ~Normal~[TAG_NORMAL_GAME] or ~Ironman~[TAG_IRONMAN])
TAG_HMU_CHAR_BARTERING_UI	TAG_HMU_ROOT			Bartering UI	The Bartering interface looks very similar to the character ~inventory~[TAG_HMU_CHAR_INVENTORY_UI] with an extra pane on the left side for the NPC's inventory. Hovering over any item in your character's inventory will display the price that the NPC will buy it for, and hovering over any item in the NPC's inventory will tell you what the NPC will sell it for.

In some cases, the NPC will refuse to buy or sell an item, and he will tell you if that is the case.All shopkeepers can identify magic items, for a price. Simply click the Identify button and you will get a special identify cursor. Click on any unidentified magic item in your inventory and for 100 gp the shopkeeper will identify it.
TAG_HMU_CAMPING_UI	TAG_HMU_ROOT			Camping UI	The Rest/Pass Time icon lets "fast-forward" time, either a set amount, in days and hours, or until a condition is met. Click on the Rest or Pass Time button after making your selection, or click on Cancel to go back to the game.Note: While you can pass time anywhere, you are only allowed to rest in certain locations (usually at inns, if you pay first, or in the wilderness or in dungeons). If the Rest/Pass Time icon looks like a watch, you can only pass time. If it looks like a tent, you can rest. You must rest to heal and recover spells.Before resting, look carefully at the tent icon. If the background is green, you can rest safely without interruption. However, if it is yellow, you may have a ~random encounter~[TAG_HMU_RANDOM_ENCOUNTER_UI] while you rest. The type of encounter you have will depend on your location, and you cannot avoid it with the ~Survival~[TAG_SURVIVAL] skill.
TAG_HMU_CHAR_UI	TAG_HMU_ROOT			Character Screen UI	Here you may view your character's ~inventory~[TAG_HMU_CHAR_INVENTORY_UI], ~portrait~[TAG_CHARGEN_PORTRAIT], ~stats~[TAG_CHARGEN_STATS], ~skills~[TAG_SKILLS], ~feats~[TAG_FEATS], ~spells~[TAG_SPELLS] and ~abilities~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_DESC] of the character.

Two buttons representing affiliation will be in the interface; one reads "Positive" and the other, "Negative".If you select the Positive affiliation, your cleric will turn undead and spontaneously cast Cure spells. If you select the Negative affiliation, your cleric will rebuke undead and spontaneously cast Inflict spells.
TAG_HMU_COMBAT_UI	TAG_HMU_ROOT			Combat UI	When entering ~combat~[TAG_COMBAT], a row of character and monster portraits will appear at the top of the screen, in order of ~initiative~[TAG_INITIATIVE]. On the left side of the screen, a bar will appear. The combat system in the game translates the actions you have available into a numerical score and displays that score as a bar, with three colors. The action bar, path movement, and the entries on the ~radial menu~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU] are all color coded as follows:Green: An action can be performed, and you will still be able to attack afterward (for ~move actions~[TAG_MOVEMENT_ACTION]) or move afterward (for attacks).Yellow: An action can be performed, but you will not be able to attack afterward (for move actions) or move much (for attacks).Red: An action cannot be performed.

The game will initialize your formations to several standard formations, including the two-column formation, the T formation, and the V formation.
TAG_HMU_HELP_UI	TAG_HMU_ROOT			Help UI	The ~Help~[TAG_ROOT] icon activates the in-game help system. In this interface, you can access nearly every facet of the game, including the 3.5 D&D rules and definitions. The interface works like a browser, and links show as blue text. Click on any blue text to access more detailed information on that topic.The six blue buttons along the bottom allow you to move through the database. The first two buttons are similar to a browser's back and next buttons. The third button is a home button and takes you to the topmost page of the database.

TAG_HMU_CHAR_INVENTORY_UI	TAG_HMU_ROOT			Inventory UI	Character inventory may be found either by right-clicking on the character portrait at the bottom left corner of the game screen or by right-clicking on the character itself, which will bring up the ~radial menu~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU]. Selecting the Backpack icon and then the tab that says "Inventory" will open the interface as well.Available items and armor will be displayed on the left side of the interface, with different colored tabs lining the top. The four tabs along the top allow access to different equipped item configurations, which you can set up in advance and then quickly swap configurations using the tabs. To create a configuration, simply drag items into its positions. When you switch away from a configuration, all equipped items return to your inventory. When you switch back to a configuration, all of its previously equipped items are re-equipped.When hovering on any item, a description will pop up in the blank text box on the bottom of the main interface, which states important characteristics like weight, ~AC~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS] bonuses, damage, etc.Directly to the right is the inventory grid, with the Backpack icon on the left side. Click the Backpack icon to open the usable inventory screen. To use an item, whether that involves putting new armor on a character or changing a weapon, click in the box on the left that holds the item and drag it into the larger box to the right into any open space. Then, at the bottom, you will see an icon/tab with a hand holding an object. Scrolling over this button will indicate that it is the "use an item" button. Next to this button is another with a hand letting go of an object; this is the "drop an item" button. Drag an item to the Use Item icon and the window will close, then the game acts as if you had selected the item to use from the radial menu. If you drag an item to the Drop Item icon, the item is removed from that character's inventory and placed on the ground at the character's location.Next to these two buttons is a blue box that reads "Total Weight" with a text box displaying the amount of weight that the character currently holds. Scrolling over this number will result in a text message that states whether or not you are ~encumbered~[TAG_ADVENTURING_ENCUMBRANCE].The Inventory interface also shows the amount of money that your character has in his or her possession, directly above the listing of character stats.
TAG_HMU_ITEM_CREATION_UI	TAG_HMU_ROOT			Item Creation UI	If your character has an ~item creation~[TAG_FEAT_TYPES] feat, such as ~Craft Wondrous Item~[TAG_CRAFT_WONDROUS] or ~Scribe Scroll~[TAG_SCRIBE_SCROLL] (see also ~Item Creation~[TAG_ITEM_CREATION] feats), they can open the Item Creation interface by right-clicking on their character to display the ~radial menu~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU]. In the radial menu, click on the Hand icon and select the item creation feat you would like your character to use.Once the feat is selected, the item creation interface will open. On the left side, choose the item you would like to create. If an item is dark gray, your character cannot create that item because necessary prerequisites are missing. If an item is red, your character does not have the needed value to create that item. On the top right side, the following aspects are listed:   - the item's name   - the ~XP~[TAG_EXPERIENCE_AND_LEVELS] cost that is required to create this item   - the monetary value of creating this item   - the prerequisite that is needed to create this itemOn the bottom, the name of your character, the remaining XP available for using, and the money that is left to spend is listed.

Click on this icon to open the Level Up interface.If it is time for your character to gain another ~feat~[TAG_FEATS], this option will be available to you in the Feats section of the Level Up interface. For most characters, this occurs at 3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th levels. ~Fighters~[TAG_FIGHTERS] gain an additional ~bonus feat~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_FIGHTER_BONUS_FEATS] at 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th, and 20th levels. ~Wizards~[TAG_WIZARDS] gain an additional ~bonus feat~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_WIZARD_BONUS_FEATS] at 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th levels.In the Level Up interface, the layout and functionality of the feats section is basically the same as it was in the character creation interface for feats. Select a feat from the list on the left and drag it into the empty box or boxes on the right.
TAG_HMU_CHAR_EDITOR_FEATURES_UI	TAG_HMU_ROOT			Level Up (Features) UI	Some ~classes~[TAG_CLASSES] get ~special abilities~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_DESC] (sometimes optional) at certain levels. The interfaces vary according to class, but all are fairly similar to the character creation interfaces. For example, a level 1, 5, 10, 15 or 20 ~ranger~[TAG_RANGERS] must pick a ~favored enemy~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_RANGER_FAVORED_ENEMY] and a level 2 ranger must pick a ~combat style~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_RANGER_COMBAT_STYLE].
TAG_HMU_CHAR_EDITOR_SKILLS_UI	TAG_HMU_ROOT			Level Up (Skills) UI	Once a character gains enough ~experience points~[TAG_EXPERIENCE_AND_LEVELS] (XP) to level up, a small icon will appear on their character portrait. Click on this icon to open the Level Up interface.The Skills segment of the Level Up interface resembles that of the Skill section in the character interface. On the right side, you will see the number of ~skill points~[TAG_ACQUIRE_SKILLS] that you are able to spend, while on the left is the ~list of skills~[TAG_SKILL_DES] that you can put points into. As before, click the up arrow to the right of the skill name to add points into any skill. Spend your new skill points for your character at a cost of 1 point per class skill and 2 points per cross-class skill.
TAG_HMU_CHAR_EDITOR_STATS_UI	TAG_HMU_ROOT			Level Up (Stats) UI	Within the Level Up interface, the section on Stats is a display of the six ~abilities~[TAG_THE_ABILITIES].

TAG_HMU_LOGBOOK_UI_EGO	TAG_HMU_ROOT			Logbook Ego UI	The Ego section of the Logbook keeps track of various party data, including combat stats, damage ranges and similar information. These data are arranged on the left page, with tabs to switch to different ego subsections. The right page shows the actual information. For example, you can select "Creatures Killed" under the Combat tab on the left side of the Ego page. The right side will then list every monster type that you have killed in the game, and tabs on that page will let you sort these monsters by CR, Hit Dice or Name.
TAG_HMU_LOGBOOK_UI_EGO_COMBAT	TAG_HMU_ROOT			Logbook Ego Combat UI	In the Ego section of the Logbook, there are three different tabs displayed on the left side, at the top of the book. The first is Combat. Clicking on this tab will reveal various stats that your character has accrued during ~combat~[TAG_COMBAT], including the following:   - Creatures Killed   - Most Experience from 1 Combat Session   - Most ~Critical Hits~[TAG_CRITICAL_HIT]   - Most Consecutive Misses   - Most Kills   - Most DeathsThat information can be sorted on the right side of the logbook, according to CR, Hit Dice, or Name of the creatures.

TAG_HMU_LOGBOOK_UI_KEYS	TAG_HMU_ROOT			Logbook Keys UI	The Keys section is similar to the ~Quest~[TAG_HMU_LOGBOOK_UI_QUESTS] and ~Reputation~[TAG_HMU_LOGBOOK_UI_REPUTATIONS] sections in that it shows all keys you have found on the left, and information on the particular selected key on the right.Note: Unlike all other items in the game, keys do not go into personal character inventories, but instead become group communal property listed here in the Logbook.
TAG_HMU_LOGBOOK_UI_QUESTS	TAG_HMU_ROOT			Logbook Quests UI	The Quests section keeps track of all quests you have accepted or even heard mentioned. The quests are arranged by the location where you received them, and these locations appear as tabs on the top of the left page. Each quest is listed on the left page--you may need to scroll if you have a lot of quests in that location.Select a quest to see its status and a description on the right page. The status of a quest is either Mentioned (you heard about the quest), Accepted (you have agreed to undertake the quest), Completed (you have finished the quest), or Botched (the quest is in a state where you can no longer complete it). You receive ~experience points~[TAG_EXPERIENCE_AND_LEVELS] for a Completed quest, and sometimes you can "unbotch" a Botched quest. For example, if you are supposed to rescue someone and they are killed, that quest is Botched. But if you resurrect the person, the quest will be unbotched and you can try to complete it.
TAG_HMU_LOGBOOK_UI_REPUTATIONS	TAG_HMU_ROOT			Logbook Reputations UI	The Reputations section is similar to the ~Quest~[TAG_HMU_LOGBOOK_UI_QUESTS] section, in that reputations you have acquired on displayed on the left, and information about the reputation on the right.

TAG_HMU_LOGBOOK_UI_RUMORS	TAG_HMU_ROOT			Logbook Rumors UI	The Rumors sections of your Logbook records rumors that you pick up through conversations with certain people which may serve as useful hints in the game.
TAG_HMU_CHAR_LOOTING_UI	TAG_HMU_ROOT			Looting UI	The Looting interface is very similar to the ~Bartering~[TAG_HMU_CHAR_BARTERING_UI] interface, with a few exceptions. Instead of an Identify button, there is a Take All button that enables your character to grab all items off another creature. Also, when scrolling over items that have been looted, there will be no prices listed, as they were not bought.Note: If you press the TAB key after killing a creature, the creature will highlight, if it has any loot in it's inventory.
TAG_HMU_MM_UI	TAG_HMU_ROOT			Main Menu UI	When the game begins, you will see the ~Main Menu~[TAG_MAIN_MENU], which contains the following options:New Game: Start a new game.

TAG_HMU_OPTIONS_UI	TAG_HMU_ROOT			Options UI	The Options menu allows you to change your video, audio and preferences settings. You can change options either from the ~Main Menu~[TAG_MAIN_MENU], before starting a game, or from within a game using the Options icon on the Main Icon Bar. Note that the Video and Audio settings are configuration settings and therefore are set for every game, while Preferences settings apply just to the game you are playing (or the next game you start, if you are at the Main Menu).
TAG_HMU_PARTY_UI	TAG_HMU_ROOT			Party UI	These portraits represent the controllable characters currently in the party. If your character is currently under the effects of a condition, you may see Buff indicators above and Ailment indicators below the portrait.

TAG_HMU_PARTY_POOL_UI	TAG_HMU_ROOT			Party Pool UI	The character pool interface is used for the creation and organization of your party. Once you create a character, the character may be added and listed on screen, with their portrait, name, and main information.There are four buttons lining the top portion of the interface: create, view, rename, and deleteCreate will bring you to the character creation interface, where you will roll stats and choose your character's ~class~[TAG_CLASSES], ~race~[TAG_RACES], and other attributes.Clicking on View will bring up a small window that holds information about a particular character in your party (the basic defining traits like class and race, as well as their character stats, etc.).Choosing the Rename button will allow you to rename a character.Delete permanently erases the selected character from the party.Toward the bottom of the interface is a button that will either read as Add or Remove, depending on the appropriate action needed. Once a new character is created and listed in the interface, you will need to select Add in order for the character to actually be included in the party. First, click on the desired character's portrait located in the row directly underneath the Add button (the character will be highlighted in blue to indicate the selection), then click Add.If the character's ~alignment~[TAG_ALIGNMENT] or class does not conflict with the party alignment that was chosen, he or she will be added to the party and highlighted in green to indicate the successful addition. If the character's alignment does conflict, then the character will be highlighted in red, indicating that it is not possible to add that character to the party. Likewise, if there is a conflict regarding class and the alignment of the party (specifically, with ~Paladins~[TAG_PALADINS], as they cannot be added to any parties with evil characters) then that character will not be added.If you would like to exclude a character from your party but not permanently delete them, click on their picture in the portrait row and select Remove. The character will no longer be highlighted in green and is removed from the party, but it will still be listed among the other party members, if you wish to add them again at a later time.
TAG_HMU_PC_CREATION_UI	TAG_HMU_ROOT			PC Creation UI	To create a new character, click on the Create button on the Party Pool screen. Character creation requires a series of steps, which you progress through by clicking on buttons on the right side of the screen. As you complete each creation step, the next button will light up, indicating you can click on it and advance to the next stage.At any time during creation, you may back up to an earlier step by clicking on the appropriate button. You will need to repeat any intermediate stages. For example, if you are picking your ~class~[TAG_CLASSES] and want to change your ~race~[TAG_RACES], click on the Race button.

Point-buying allows you to customize your character's scores, but random rolling will eventually generate better scores.If you roll, then six values are randomly generated, and you can arrange them any way you like by dragging a number from the right column into an ability score box on the left side. If you don't like the numbers, you can reroll until you're satisfied. However, the game keeps track of the number of rolls you make and displays this number on your character's Info Sheet.You can also buy your ability scores directly in Normal mode. When you use this system, your character begins with all abilities at 8 and you are given 25 points to spend on raising your abilities. Abilities cost 1 point to raise for each score up to 14, 2 points for scores 15 and 16, and 3 points for scores 17 and 18.In ~Ironman~[TAG_IRONMAN] mode, you can only roll your scores (no point buying is available), and you must accept the first roll. You can still choose how to arrange the scores, however.
TAG_HMU_PC_CREATION_ALIGNMENT_UI	TAG_HMU_ROOT			PC Creation Alignment UI	The Alignment interface is basically a boxed grouping of buttons that list the nine different ~alignments~[TAG_ALIGNMENT]. When creating a party of player characters, the party alignment will limit which characters may adventure together. In selecting one alignment, others that would potentially work with that party alignment will light up. For example, in selecting ~True Neutral~[TAG_NEUTRAL], all of the following alignments light up: ~Neutral Good~[TAG_NEUTRAL_GOOD], ~Neutral Evil~[TAG_NEUTRAL_EVIL], ~Lawful Neutral~[TAG_LAWFUL_NEUTRAL], ~Chaotic Neutral~[TAG_CHAOTIC_NEUTRAL], and of course True NeutralSo in selecting that party alignment, you may only add characters to your party that fall under one of those alignment categories.

This is measured against a ~Survival~[TAG_SURVIVAL] check and the computer will then calculate the likelihood. If this does occur, a new interface will pop up in the World Map, that reads "Survival" on the very top. Then, usually, it will have either the type of creature or the type of battle that your party is up against listed directly underneath that. Below this will be a picture icon of the creature and how many creatures are there. (For example, it could have a picture of a Shadow, then say x3 Shadow, which indicates there are three of these creatures.)At the bottom of the interface will be two buttons; the one on the left reads "Engage", the other says "Avoid".

In the cleric domain selection interface, the available domains will be listed on the left, with a space for multiple selections on the right. You will need to select and drag two domains into the space shown, which is a small box with the heading "Domains:".If the character is a neutral cleric who worships a neutral deity, additional information is needed, and a question will appear asking if your cleric character will be more proficient in wielding positive or negative energy. Only a neutral cleric of a neutral deity will be asked to provide this information. Click on the button that reads either "Positive" or "Negative" to make your decision.Once the player makes this choice, it cannot be reversed. This decision will determine whether the cleric will ~spontaneously cast~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_CLERIC_SPONTANEOUS_CASTING] Cure or Inflict spells and will also dictate whether the cleric ~turns or rebukes~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_CLERIC_TURN_REBUKE_UNDEAD] undead. In other words, a cleric who chooses to wield positive energy will spontaneously cast Cure spells and turn undead, while a cleric who decides to wield negative energy will spontaneously cast Inflict spells and rebuke undead.
TAG_CHARGEN_WIZARD_SPECIALIZATION	TAG_CHARGEN			Wizard Specialization	A ~school~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS] is one of eight groupings of spells, each defined by a common theme, such as ~Illusion~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_ILLUSION] or ~Necromancy~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_NECROMANCY]. If desired, a ~wizard~[TAG_WIZARDS] may specialize in one school of magic. Specialization allows a wizard to cast extra spells from her chosen school, but then she never learns to cast spells from some other schools. Essentially, the wizard gains exceptional mastery over a single school by neglecting the study of other schools.A specialist wizard can prepare one additional spell of her specialty per school per spell level each day. She also gains a +2 bonus on ~Spellcraft~[TAG_SPELLCRAFT] checks to learn the spells of her chosen school.The wizard must choose whether to specialize and, if she does so, choose her specialty. At this time, she must also give up two other schools of magic which become her prohibited schools. In the character creation interface, under features, a wizard has the option of choosing such a school by selecting from the list entitled "Available Schools". You will drag this school into the box with the heading "Specialized School" and then choose two other schools to be dragged into the "Prohibited Schools" box that is outlined in red.An exception to the rules noted above is the school of ~Divination~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_DIVINATION]. If Divination is chosen as the school that the wizard character will specialize in, then only one school must be selected for the "Prohibited Schools" box.
TAG_VITALS	TAG_DESCRIPTION			Vital Statistics and Looks	Name: Invent or choose a name that fits your character's race and class.Gender: You character can be either male or female.Looks: You will have the option of selecting a hair style and hair color for your character, as well as a character portrait.~Height~[TAG_HEIGHT]~Weight~[TAG_WEIGHT]~Hit Points~[TAG_HIT_POINTS]
TAG_HIT_POINTS	TAG_VITALS			Hit Points	A measure of a character's health or an object's integrity. Damage decreases current hit points and lost hit points return with healing or natural recovery. A character's hit point total increases permanently with additional ~experience~[TAG_EXPERIENCE_AND_LEVELS] and/or permanent increases in ~Constitution~[TAG_CONSTITUTION], or temporarily through the use of various special abilities, spells, ~magic items~[TAG_MAGIC_ITEMS], or magical effects (see ~temporary hit points~[TAG_TEMPORARY_HIT_POINTS]). The more hit points a character has, the more difficult he is to kill.At 0 hit points, he is ~disabled~[TAG_DISABLED].At -1 to -9 hit points, he is ~dying~[TAG_DYING].At -10 (or lower), he is ~dead~[TAG_DEAD].
TAG_HEIGHT	TAG_VITALS			Height	The height of your character simply provides a more accurate visual representation within the game. For example, if your character is a ~halfling~[TAG_HALFLINGS], he or she will appear significantly shorter than the rest of the party. Other than this, height has no other affect upon anything in the game.
TAG_WEIGHT	TAG_VITALS			Weight	The weight of your character has no affect upon anything in the game. You decide the weight of your character when you choose the height; it is scaled to match height.
TAG_ALIGNMENT	TAG_DESCRIPTION			Alignment	[CMD_CHILDREN]
TAG_LAWFUL_GOOD	TAG_ALIGNMENT			Lawful Good, "Crusader"	A Lawful Good character acts as a good person is expected or required to act.  She combines a commitment to oppose evil with the discipline to fight relentlessly.  She tells the truth, keeps her word, helps those in need, and speaks out against injustice.  A Lawful Good character hates to see the guilty go unpunished. Lawful Good can be a positive alignment because it combines honor and compassion.
TAG_NEUTRAL_GOOD	TAG_ALIGNMENT			Neutral Good, "Benefactor"	A Neutral Good character does the best that a good person can do.  He is devoted to helping others.  He works best with kings and magistrates but does not feel beholden to them.  For example, a ~cleric~[TAG_CLERICS] who helps others according to their needs is Neutral Good. Neutral Good is an advantageous alignment because it means doing what is good without bias for or against order.
TAG_CHAOTIC_GOOD	TAG_ALIGNMENT			Chaotic Good, "Rebel"	A Chaotic Good character acts as his conscience directs him with little regard for what others expect of him.  He makes his own way, but he's kind and benevolent.  He believes in goodness and right but has little use for laws and regulations.  He hates it when people try to intimidate others and tell them what to do.  He follows his own moral compass, which although good, may not agree with that of society.  For example, a ~ranger~[TAG_RANGERS] who waylays the evil baron's tax collectors is Chaotic Good. Chaotic Good is favored by some because it combines a good heart with a free spirit.
TAG_LAWFUL_NEUTRAL	TAG_ALIGNMENT			Lawful Neutral, "Judge"	A Lawful Neutral character acts as law, tradition, or a personal code directs her.  Order and organization are paramount to her.  She may believe in personal order and live by a code or standard, or she may believe in order for all and favor a strong, organized government.  For example, a ~monk~[TAG_MONKS] who follows her discipline without being swayed either by the demands of those in need or by the temptations of evil, is Lawful Neutral. Lawful Neutral is considered a good alignment because it means you are reliable and honorable without being a zealot.
TAG_NEUTRAL	TAG_ALIGNMENT			True Neutral, "Undecided"	A True Neutral character does what seems to be a good idea.  He doesn't feel strongly one way or the other when it comes to good vs. evil or law vs. chaos.  Most True Neutral characters exhibit a lack of conviction or bias rather than commitment to neutrality.  Such a character thinks of good as better than evil--after all, he would rather have good neighbors and rulers than evil ones.  Still, he's not personally committed to upholding good in any abstract or universal way.  For example, a ~wizard~[TAG_WIZARDS] who devotes himself to his art and is bored by the semantics of moral debate is True Neutral. Some True Neutral characters, on the other hand, commit themselves philosophically to neutrality.  They see good, evil, law, and chaos as prejudices and dangerous extremes.  They advocate the middle way of neutrality as the best, most balanced road in the long run. True Neutral is an alignment favored because it means you can act naturally, without prejudice or compulsion.
TAG_CHAOTIC_NEUTRAL	TAG_ALIGNMENT			Chaotic Neutral, "Free Spirit"	A Chaotic Neutral character follows her whims.  She is an individualist first and foremost.  She values her own liberty but doesn't strive to protect others' freedom.  She avoids authority, resents restrictions, and challenges traditions.  A Chaotic Neutral character does not intentionally disrupt organizations as part of a campaign of anarchy.  To do so, she would have to be motivated either by good (and a desire to liberate others) or evil (and a desire to make those different from herself suffer).  A Chaotic Neutral character may be unpredictable, but her behavior is not totally random.  She is not as likely to jump off a bridge as to cross it.  For example, a ~bard~[TAG_BARDS] who wanders the land living by his wits is Chaotic Neutral. Chaotic Neutral is thought of as the best alignment by some because it represents true freedom from both society's restrictions and a do-gooder's zeal.
TAG_LAWFUL_EVIL	TAG_ALIGNMENT			Lawful Evil, "Dominator"	A Lawful Evil character methodically takes what he wants within the limits of his code of conduct without regard for whom it hurts.  He cares about tradition, loyalty, and order, but not about freedom, dignity, or life.  He plays by the rules but without mercy or compassion.  He is comfortable in a hierarchy and would like to rule, but is willing to serve.  He condemns others not according to their actions but according to race, religion, homeland, or social rank.  He is loath to break laws or promises.  This reluctance comes partly from his nature and partly because he depends on order to protect himself from those who oppose him on moral grounds.  Some Lawful Evil villains have particular taboos, such as not killing in cold blood (but having underlings do it) or not letting children come to harm (if it can be helped).  They imagine that these compunctions put them above unprincipled villains.  The scheming baron who expands his power and exploits his people is Lawful Evil. Some Lawful Evil people and creatures commit themselves to evil with a zeal like that of a crusader committed to good.  Beyond being willing to hurt others for their own ends, they take pleasure in spreading evil as an end unto itself.  They may also see doing evil as part of a duty to an evil deity or master. Lawful Evil is sometimes called "diabolical" because devils are the epitome of this alignment. Lawful Evil is a dangerous alignment because is represents methodical, intentional, and frequently successful evil.
TAG_NEUTRAL_EVIL	TAG_ALIGNMENT			Neutral Evil, "Malefactor"	A Neutral Evil character does whatever she can get away with.  She is out for herself, pure and simple.  She sheds no tears for those she kills, whether for profit, sport, or convenience.  She has no love of order and holds no illusion that following laws, traditions, or codes would make her any better or more noble.  On the other hand, she doesn't have the reckless nature or love of conflict that a Chaotic Evil villain has.  The criminal who robs and murders to get what she wants is Neutral Evil. Some Neutral Evil villains hold up evil as an ideal, committing evil for its own sake.  Most often, such villains are devoted to evil deities or secret societies. Neutral Evil is considered to be a dangerous alignment because it represents pure evil without honor and without variation.
TAG_CHAOTIC_EVIL	TAG_ALIGNMENT			Chaotic Evil, "Destroyer"	A Chaotic Evil character does whatever his greed, hatred, and lust for destruction drive him to do.  He is hot-tempered, vicious, arbitrarily violent, and unpredictable.  If he is simply out for whatever he can get, he is ruthless and brutal.  If he is committed to the spread of evil and chaos, he is even worse.  Thankfully, his plans are haphazard, and any groups he joins or forms are poorly organized.  Typically, Chaotic Evil people can be made to work together only by force, and their leader lasts only as long as he can thwart attempts to topple or assassinate him.  The demented ~sorcerer~[TAG_SORCERERS] pursuing mad schemes of vengeance and havoc is Chaotic Evil. Chaotic Evil is sometimes called "demonic" because demons are the epitome of this particular alignment. Chaotic Evil is thought of as dangerous because it represents the destruction not only of beauty and life but also of the order on which beauty and life depend.
TAG_RELIGION	TAG_DESCRIPTION			Religion	You may select a patron deity for your character.  Alternatively, you may choose to have your character not have a patron deity.  However, if you choose to select NONE as your character's deity, he/she cannot be a ~cleric~[TAG_CLERICS], nor will he/she ever be able to take a level of cleric as a ~multi-class~[TAG_MULTICLASS]. Deities are restricted by race, class, and alignment.

If you are unhappy with them, you have the option of rolling again (not in the ~Ironman Mode~[TAG_IRONMAN] however) until you are satisfied with them. You then will need to assign the six die rolls to that character's abilities.After each assigned die roll, the ~ability modifier~[TAG_ABILITY_MODIFIERS] will be displayed.Finally, it is important for spellcasters to know which ability governs bonus spells for their particular type of magic.     ~Wizards~[TAG_WIZARDS] use ~intelligence~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE].     ~Clerics~[TAG_CLERICS], ~druids~[TAG_DRUIDS], ~paladins~[TAG_PALADINS], and ~rangers~[TAG_RANGERS] use ~wisdom~[TAG_WISDOM].     ~Sorcerers~[TAG_SORCERERS] and ~bards~[TAG_BARDS] use ~charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA].If the spellcaster's abilitiy score is 10 or lower, you will not be able to cast spells tied to that ability.
TAG_CHANGE_ABILITY_SCORES	TAG_ABILITIES			Changing Ability Scores	Over time, the ability scores your character starts with can change. Ability scores can increase with no limit. Points at which ability changes occur include the following:-- Add 1 point to any score at 4th level and at every fourth level your character attains (4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 20th levels).-- Many spells and magical effects temporarily increase or decrease ability scores. -- Several magical items improve ability scores as long as the character is using them. -- Some rare magical items can boost an ability score permanently. Such an increase is called an inherent bonus. An ability score cannot have an inherent bonus of more than +5.-- ~Poisons~[TAG_POISON], ~diseases~[TAG_DISEASED], and other effects can temporarily harm an ability. Ability points lost to damage return on their own at a rate of 1 point per day for each damaged ability.-- Some effects drain abilities, resulting in a permanent loss. Points lost this way don't return on their own, but they can be regained with spells.Note that when an ability score changes, all attributes associated with that score change accordingly, including the ~ability modifier~[TAG_ABILITY_MODIFIERS].
TAG_THE_ABILITIES	TAG_ABILITIES			The Abilities	[CMD_CHILDREN]
TAG_STRENGTH	TAG_THE_ABILITIES			Strength	Strength measures your character's muscle and physical power. This ability is especially important for ~fighters~[TAG_FIGHTERS], ~barbarians~[TAG_BARBARIANS], ~paladins~[TAG_PALADINS], ~rangers~[TAG_RANGERS], and ~monks~[TAG_MONKS] because it helps them prevail in combat. Strength also limits the amount of ~equipment~[TAG_EQUIPMENT] your characters can carry.You apply your character's Strength modifier to:-- Melee ~attack rolls~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL]-- Damage rolls when using a melee weapon or a ~thrown weapon~[TAG_THROW_WEAPON]-- Strength checks (for breaking down doors and the like).
TAG_DEXTERITY	TAG_THE_ABILITIES			Dexterity	Dexterity measures hand-eye coordination, agility, reflexes, and balance. This ability is the most important one for ~rogues~[TAG_ROGUES], but it is also high on the list for characters who typically wear light or medium armor (~rangers~[TAG_RANGERS] or ~barbarians~[TAG_BARBARIANS]) or no armor at all (~monks~[TAG_MONKS], ~wizards~[TAG_WIZARDS], or ~sorcerers~[TAG_SORCERERS]), and for anyone who wants to be a skilled archer.You apply your character's Dexterity modifier to:-- Ranged ~attack rolls~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL], including those for attacks made with crossbows (~light~[TAG_WEAPONS_CROSSBOW_LIGHT] or ~heavy~[TAG_WEAPONS_CROSSBOW_HEAVY]) and other ranged weapons-- ~Armor Class~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS] (AC), provided that the character can react to the attack.-- ~Reflex~[TAG_REFLEX] ~saving throws~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC] for avoiding ~Fireballs~[TAG_SPELLS_FIREBALL] and other attacks that you can escape by moving quickly-- ~Hide~[TAG_HIDE], ~Move Silently~[TAG_MOVE_SILENTLY], ~Open Lock~[TAG_OPEN_LOCK], and ~Sleight of Hand~[TAG_SLEIGHT]. These are the ~skills~[TAG_SKILLS] that have Dexterity as their key ability.
TAG_CONSTITUTION	TAG_THE_ABILITIES			Constitution	Constitution represents your character's health and stamina. A Constitution bonus increases a character's ~hit points~[TAG_HIT_POINTS], so the ability is important for all classes.You apply your character's Constitution modifier to:-- Each roll of a Hit Die (though a die roll can never drop below 1 due to a penalty)-- ~Fortitude~[TAG_FORTITUDE] ~saving throws~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC] for resisting ~poison~[TAG_POISON] and similar threats-- ~Concentration~[TAG_CONCENTRATION] checks. Concentration is a ~skill~[TAG_SKILLS], important to spellcasters, that has Constitution as its key ability.If a character's Constitution score changes enough to alter his or her Constitution modifier, the character's hit points also increase or decrease accordingly.
TAG_INTELLIGENCE	TAG_THE_ABILITIES			Intelligence	Intelligence determines how well your character learns and reasons. This ability is important for ~wizards~[TAG_WIZARDS] because it affects how many spells they can cast, how hard their spells are to resist, and how powerful their spells can be. It's also important for any character who wants to have a wide assortment of skills.You apply your character's Intelligence modifier to:-- The number of ~skill points~[TAG_ACQUIRE_SKILLS] gained each level. (But your characters always get at least 1 skill point per level.)-- ~Appraise~[TAG_APPRAISE], ~Disable Device~[TAG_DISABLE_DEVICE], ~Search~[TAG_SEARCH], and ~Spellcraft~[TAG_SPELLCRAFT] checks. These are the ~skills~[TAG_SKILLS] that have Intelligence as their key ability.A wizard gains bonus spells based on her Intelligence score. The minimum Intelligence score needed to cast a wizard spell is 10 + the spell's level.An animal has an Intelligence score of 1 or 2. A creature of humanlike intelligence has a score of at least 3.
TAG_WISDOM	TAG_THE_ABILITIES			Wisdom	Wisdom describes a character's willpower, common sense, perception, and intuition. While ~Intelligence~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE] represents one's ability to analyze information, Wisdom represents being in tune with and aware of one's surroundings. An "absentminded professor" has low Wisdom and high Intelligence. A simpleton (low Intelligence) might still have great insight (high Wisdom). Wisdom is the most important ability for ~clerics~[TAG_CLERICS] and ~druids~[TAG_DRUIDS], and it is also important for ~paladins~[TAG_PALADINS] and ~rangers~[TAG_RANGERS]. If you want your character to have acute senses, put a high score in Wisdom. Every creature has a Wisdom score.You apply your character's Wisdom modifier to:-- ~Will~[TAG_WILL] ~saving throws~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC] for negating the effects of ~Charm Person~[TAG_SPELLS_CHARM_PERSON] and other spells-- ~Heal~[TAG_HEAL], ~Listen~[TAG_LISTEN], ~Sense Motive~[TAG_SENSE_MOTIVE], ~Spot~[TAG_SPOT], and ~Survival~[TAG_SURVIVAL] checks. These are the ~skills~[TAG_SKILLS] that have Wisdom as their key ability.Clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers get bonus spells based on their Wisdom scores. The minimum Wisdom score needed to cast a cleric, druid, paladin, or ranger spell is 10 + the spell's level.
TAG_CHARISMA	TAG_THE_ABILITIES			Charisma	Charisma measures a character's force of personality, persuasiveness, personal magnetism, ability to lead, and physical attractiveness. This ability represents actual strength of personality, not merely how one is perceived by others in a social setting. Charisma is most important for ~paladins~[TAG_PALADINS], ~sorcerers~[TAG_SORCERERS], and ~bards~[TAG_BARDS]. It is also important for ~clerics~[TAG_CLERICS], since it affects their ability to ~turn or rebuke~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_CLERIC_TURN_REBUKE_UNDEAD] undead. Every creature has a Charisma score.You apply your character's Charisma modifier to:-- ~Bluff~[TAG_BLUFF], ~Diplomacy~[TAG_DIPLOMACY], ~Gather Information~[TAG_GATHER_INFORMATION], ~Intimidate~[TAG_INTIMIDATE], ~Perform~[TAG_PERFORM], and ~Use Magic Device~[TAG_UMD] checks. These are the ~skills~[TAG_SKILLS] that have Charisma as their key ability.-- Checks that represent attempts to influence others.-- Turning checks for clerics and paladins attempting to turn zombies, skeletons, and other undead.Sorcerers and bards get bonus spells based on their Charisma scores. The minimum Charisma score needed to cast a sorcerer or bard spell is 10 + the spell's level.
TAG_ABILITY_MODIFIERS  	TAG_ABILITY_SCORES			Ability Modifiers	Each ability, after changes made because of ~race~[TAG_RACES], has a modifier ranging from -5 to +5. The modifier is the number you apply to the die rolls when your character tries to do something related to that ability.Ability Score        Modifier---------------       ----------    1                           @t-5    2-3                       @t-4    4-5                       @t-3     6-7                       @t-2    8-9                       @t-1    10-11                   @t 0    12-13                  @t+1    14-15                  @t+2    16-17                  @t+3    18-19                  @t+4    20-21                  @t+5
TAG_RACES				Races	[CMD_CHILDREN]
TAG_RACIAL_CHARACTERISTICS	TAG_RACES			Racial Characteristics	Your character's race determines some of his or her qualities.Depending on what race you choose, your character's abilities may be modified by ability adjustments. Each race has a favored class, which comes into play for characters choosing to ~multiclass~[TAG_MULTICLASS].
TAG_HUMANS	TAG_RACES			Humans	Most humans are the descendants of pioneers, conquerors, traders, travelers, refugees, and other people on the move. As a result, human lands are home to a mix of people--physically, culturally, religiously, and politically different. Hardy or fine, light-skinned or dark, showy or austere, primitive or civilized, devout or impious, humans run the gamut.Physical Description: Humans typically stand from 5 feet to a little over 6 feet tall and weigh from 125 to 250 pounds, with men noticeably taller and heavier than women. Humans have short life spans, reaching adulthood at about age 15 and rarely living even a single century.Alignment: Humans tend toward no particular alignment, not even neutrality. The best and the worst are found among them.Religion: Unlike members of the other common races, humans do not have a chief racial deity. ~Pelor~[TAG_PELOR], the sun god, is the most commonly worshiped deity in human lands, but he can claim nothing like the central place that the ~dwarves~[TAG_DWARVES] give ~Moradin~[TAG_MORADIN] or the ~elves~[TAG_ELVES] give ~Corellon Larethian~[TAG_CORELLON] in their respective pantheons. Racial Traits:-- Medium: As Medium creatures, humans have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.-- Human base land speed is 30 feet.-- 1 extra ~feat~[TAG_FEATS] at 1st level.-- 4 extra ~skill points~[TAG_ACQUIRE_SKILLS] at 1st level and 1 extra skill point at each additional level.-- Favored Class: Any. When determining whether a multiclass human takes an experience point penalty, her highest-level class does not count.
TAG_DWARVES	TAG_RACES			Dwarves	Dwarves are known for their skill in warfare, their ability to withstand physical and magical punishments, their knowledge of the earth's secrets, their hard work, and their capacity for drinking ale. Their mysterious kingdoms, carved from the insides of mountains, are renowned for the marvelous treasures that they produce as gifts for trade.Physical Description: Dwarves stand only 4 to 4 1/2 feet tall, but they are so broad and compact that they are, on average, almost as heavy as ~humans~[TAG_HUMANS]. Dwarf men are slightly taller and noticeably heavier than dwarf women. Dwarf men value their beards and groom them very carefully. Dwarves are considered adults at about age 40, and they can live to be more than 400 years old.Alignment: Dwarves are usually lawful, and they tend toward good. Adventuring dwarves are less likely to fit the common mold, however, since they're more likely to be those who didn't fit perfectly into dwarven society.Religion: The chief deity of the dwarves is ~Moradin~[TAG_MORADIN], "the Soul Forger". He is the creator of the dwarves, and he expects his followers to work for the betterment of the dwarf race.Racial Traits:-- +2 ~Constitution~[TAG_CONSTITUTION], -2 ~Charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA]-- Medium: As Medium creatures, dwarves have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.-- Dwarf base land speed is 20 feet. However, dwarves can move at this speed even when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load.-- Weapon Familiarity: Dwarves may treat ~dwarven waraxes~[TAG_WEAPONS_WARAXE_DWARVEN] as martial weapons rather than exotic weapons. In ToEE, a dwarf has the ~Exotic Weapon Proficiency~[TAG_EXOTIC_PROF] feat for the Dwarven Waraxe.-- Stability: +4 bonus on ability checks made to resist being ~tripped~[TAG_TRIP] when standing on the ground.-- +2 racial bonus on ~saving throws~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC] against ~poison~[TAG_POISON].-- +2 racial bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like effects.-- +1 racial bonus on ~attack rolls~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL] against orcs and goblinoids (such as goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears).-- +4 dodge bonus to ~Armor Class~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS] against creatures of the giant type (such as ogres, trolls, and hill giants).-- +2 racial bonus on ~Appraise~[TAG_APPRAISE] checks that are related to stone or metal items.-- Favored Class: ~Fighter~[TAG_FIGHTERS]. A multiclass dwarf's fighter class does not count when determining whether he takes an experience point penalty for multiclassing.
TAG_ELVES	TAG_RACES			Elves	Elves mingle freely in ~human~[TAG_HUMANS] lands, always welcome yet never at home there. They are well known for their poetry, dance, song, lore, and magical arts. Elves favor things of natural and simple beauty. When danger threatens their woodland homes, however, elves reveal a more martial side, demonstrating skill with sword, bow, and battle strategy.Physical Description: Elves are short and slim, standing about 4 1/2 to 5 1/2 feet tall and typically weighing 85 to 135 pounds, with elf men the same height as and only marginally heavier than elf women. They are graceful but frail. An elf reaches adulthood at about 110 years of age and can live to be more than 700 years old. Elves do not sleep, as members of other common races do. Instead, an elf meditates in a deep trance for 4 hours a day.Alignment: Since elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. Generally, they value and protect others' freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not. Religion: Above all others, elves worship ~Corellon Larethian~[TAG_CORELLON], "the Protector and Preserver of life". Elven myth holds that it was from his blood, shed in battle with ~Gruumsh~[TAG_GRUUMSH], the chief god of the orcs, that the elves first arose.Racial Traits:-- +2 ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY], -2 ~Constitution~[TAG_CONSTITUTION]-- Medium: As Medium creatures, elves have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.-- Elf base land speed is 30 feet.-- Immunity to magic ~sleep~[TAG_SPELLS_SLEEP] spells and effects, and a +2 racial ~saving throw~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC] bonus against ~enchantment~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_ENCHANTMENT] spells or effects.-- Weapon Proficiency: Elves receive the ~Martial Weapon Proficiency~[TAG_MARTIAL_PROF] feats for the ~longsword~[TAG_WEAPONS_LONGSWORD], ~rapier~[TAG_WEAPONS_RAPIER], ~longbow~[TAG_WEAPONS_LONGBOW], and ~shortbow~[TAG_WEAPONS_SHORTBOW] as bonus feats. -- +2 racial bonuses on ~Listen~[TAG_LISTEN], ~Search~[TAG_SEARCH], and ~Spot~[TAG_SPOT] checks. An elf who merely passes within 5 feet of a secret or concealed door is entitled to a Search check to notice it as if she were actively looking for it.-- Favored Class: ~Wizard~[TAG_WIZARDS]. A multiclass elf's wizard class does not count when determining whether she takes an experience point penalty for multiclassing.
TAG_GNOMES	TAG_RACES			Gnomes	Gnomes are welcome everywhere as technicians, alchemists, and inventors. Despite the demand for their skills, most gnomes prefer to remain among their own kind, living in comfortable burrows beneath the rolling, wooded hills where animals abound.Physical Description: Gnomes stand about 3 to 3 1/2 feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds. Gnomes reach adulthood at about age 40, and they typically live about 350 years, though some can live almost 500 years.Alignment: Gnomes are most often good. Those who tend toward law are sages, engineers, researchers, scholars, or investigators. Those who tend toward chaos are minstrels or wanderers. Gnomes are good-hearted, and even the tricksters among them are more playful than vicious. Evil gnomes are as rare as they are frightening. Religion: The chief gnome god is ~Garl Glittergold~[TAG_GARL], "the Watchful Protector". Racial Traits:-- +2 ~Constitution~[TAG_CONSTITUTION], -2 ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH]-- Small: As a Small creature, a gnome gains a +1 ~size~[TAG_SIZE_MODIFIER] bonus to ~Armor Class~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS], a +1 size bonus on ~attack rolls~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL], and a +4 bonus on ~Hide~[TAG_HIDE] checks, but he must use smaller weapons than ~humans~[TAG_HUMANS] use, and his lifting and carrying limits are three-quarters of those of a Medium character.-- Gnome base land speed is 20 feet.-- Weapon Familiarity: Gnomes may treat ~gnome hooked hammers~[TAG_WEAPONS_HAMMER_GNOME_HOOKED] as martial weapons rather than exotic weapons. In ToEE, a gnome has the ~Exotic Weapon Proficiency~[TAG_EXOTIC_PROF] feat for the Gnome Hooked Hammer.-- +2 racial bonus on ~saving throws~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC] against illusions.-- Add +1 to the Difficulty Class for all saving throws against ~illusion~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_ILLUSION] spells cast by gnomes.-- +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against kobolds and goblinoids (such as goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears).-- +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against creatures of the giant type (such as ogres, trolls, and hill giants).-- +2 racial bonus on ~Listen~[TAG_LISTEN] checks.-- Favored Class: ~Bard~[TAG_BARDS]. A multiclass gnome's bard class does not count when determining whether he takes an experience point penalty.
TAG_HALF_ELVES	TAG_RACES			Half-Elves	~Humans~[TAG_HUMANS] and ~elves~[TAG_ELVES] sometimes wed, the elf attracted to the human's energy and the human to the elf's grace. These marriages end quickly because a human's life is so brief (compared to an elf's life span of hundreds of years), but they leave an enduring legacy--half-elf children. The life of a half-elf can be hard. Most find places for themselves eventually in human lands, but some feel like outsiders all their lives.Physical Description: Half-elf height ranges from under 5 feet to about 6 feet tall, and weight usually ranges from 90 to 180 pounds. Half-elf men are taller and heavier than half-elf women, but the difference is less pronounced than that found among humans. A half-elf reaches adulthood at age 20 and can live to be more than 180 years old.Alignment: Half-elves share the chaotic bent of their elven heritage, but, like humans, they tend toward good and evil in equal proportion. Like elves, they value personal freedom and creative expression, demonstrating neither love of leaders nor desire for followers. They chafe at rules, resent others' demands, and sometimes prove unreliable, or at least unpredictable. Religion: Half-elves raised among elves follow elven deities, principally ~Correlon Larethian~[TAG_CORELLON]. Those raised among humans follow ~Ehlonna~[TAG_EHLONNA].Racial Traits:-- Medium: As Medium creatures, half-elves have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.-- Half-elf base land speed is 30 feet.-- Immunity to ~sleep~[TAG_SPELLS_SLEEP] spells and similar magical effects, and a +2 racial bonus on ~saving throws~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC] against ~enchantment~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_ENCHANTMENT] spells or effects.-- +1 racial bonus on ~Listen~[TAG_LISTEN], ~Search~[TAG_SEARCH], and ~Spot~[TAG_SPOT] checks. A half-elf does not have the elf's ability to notice secret doors simply by passing near them.-- +2 racial bonus on ~Diplomacy~[TAG_DIPLOMACY] and ~Gather Information~[TAG_GATHER_INFORMATION] checks.-- Elven Blood: For all effects related to race, a half-elf is considered an elf.-- Favored Class: Any. When determining whether a multiclass half-elf takes an experience point penalty, her highest-level class does not count.
TAG_HALF_ORCS	TAG_RACES			Half-Orcs	In the wild frontiers, tribes of ~humans~[TAG_HUMANS] and orc barbarians live in uneasy balance, fighting in times of war and trading in times of peace. Half-orcs who are born in the frontier may live with either human or orc parents, but they are nevertheless exposed to both cultures. Some, for whatever reasons, leave their homeland and travel to civilized lands, bringing with them the tenacity, courage, and combat prowess that they developed in the wilds.Physical Description: Half-orcs stand between 6 and 7 feet tall and usually weigh between 200 and 250 pounds. Many half-orcs have scars, whether as symbols of pride or shame. Half-orcs mature a little faster than humans and age noticeably faster. They reach adulthood at age 14, and few live longer than 75 years.Alignment: Half-orcs inherit a tendency toward chaos from their orc parents, but, like their human parents, they favor good and evil in equal proportions. Half-orcs raised among orcs and willing to live out their lives with them are usually the evil ones.Religion: Like orcs, many half-orcs worship ~Gruumsh~[TAG_GRUUMSH], the chief orc god and arch-enemy of ~Corellon Larethian~[TAG_CORELLON], the god of the elves. Half-orcs who want to solidify their connection to their human heritage, on the other hand, follow human gods, and they may be outspoken in their shows of piety.Racial Traits:-- +2 ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH], -2 ~Intelligence~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE], -2 ~Charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA]-- Medium: As Medium creatures, half-orcs have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.-- Half-orc base land speed is 30 feet.-- Orc Blood: For all effects related to race, a half-orc is considered an orc.-- Favored Class: ~Barbarian~[TAG_BARBARIANS]. A multiclass half-orc's barbarian class does not count when determining whether he takes an experience point penalty.
TAG_HALFLINGS	TAG_RACES			Halflings	Halflings are clever, capable opportunists. Halfling individuals and clans find room for themselves wherever they can. Often they are strangers and wanderers, and others react to them with suspicion or curiosity. Depending on the clan, halflings might be reliable, hardworking citizens, or they might be thieves just waiting for the opportunity to make a big score and disappear in the dead of night. Regardless, halflings are cunning and resourceful survivors.Physical Description: Halflings stand about 3 feet tall and usually weigh between 30 and 35 pounds. A halfling reaches adulthood at the age of 20 and usually lives into the middle of her second century.Alignment: Halflings tend to be neutral. While they are comfortable with change (a chaotic trait), they also tend to rely on intangible constants, such as clan ties and personal honor (a lawful trait).Religion: The chief halfling deity is ~Yondalla~[TAG_YONDALLA], "the Blessed One", protector of the halflings. Halflings also recognize countless lesser gods, who rule over individual villages, forests, rivers, lakes, and so on. The halflings pay homage to these deities to ensure safe journey as they travel from place to place.Racial Traits:-- +2 ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY], -2 ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH]-- Small: As a Small creature, a halfling gains a +1 ~size~[TAG_SIZE_MODIFIER] bonus to ~Armor Class~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS], a +1 size bonus on ~attack rolls~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL], and a +4 bonus on ~Hide~[TAG_HIDE] checks, but she must use smaller weapons than ~humans~[TAG_HUMANS] use, and her lifting and carrying limits are three quarters of those of a Medium character.-- Halfling base land speed is 20 feet.-- +2 racial bonus on ~Listen~[TAG_LISTEN] and ~Move Silently~[TAG_MOVE_SILENTLY] checks.-- +1 racial bonus on all ~saving throws~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC].-- +2 morale bonus on saving throws against ~fear~[TAG_FEAR]. This bonus stacks with the halfling's +1 bonus on saving throws in general.-- +1 racial attack bonus with ~thrown weapons~[TAG_THROW_WEAPON] and ~slings~[TAG_WEAPONS_SLING].-- Favored Class: ~Rogue~[TAG_ROGUES]. A multiclass halfling's rogue class does not count when determining whether she takes an experience point penalty for multiclassing.

TAG_LEVEL_BONUSES	TAG_CLASSES			Class and Level Bonuses	An ~attack roll~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL], ~saving throw~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC], or ~skill check~[TAG_USING_SKILLS] is a combination of three numbers, each representing a different factor: a random factor (the number you roll on a d20), a number representing the character's innate abilities (the ability modifier), and a bonus representing the character's experience and training. This third factor depends, either directly or indirectly, on the character's class and level.Base Save Bonus (BSB): As the character gains levels, this bonus increases for ~Fortitude~[TAG_FORTITUDE], ~Will~[TAG_WILL], and ~Reflex~[TAG_REFLEX] saving throws. Depending on the character's class, this increase can be either Good or Poor.Base Attack Bonus (BAB): As the character gains levels, this bonus adds to the attack roll. Depending on the character's class, this increase can be Good, Average, or Poor.  Additional attacks receive a reduced bonus.Class BAB and BSB~Barbarian~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARBARIAN]~Bard~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD]~Cleric~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_CLERIC]~Druid~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_DRUID]~Fighter~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_FIGHTER]~Monk~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MONK]~Paladin~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_PALADIN]~Ranger~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_RANGER]~Rogue~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE]~Sorcerer~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_SORCERER]~Wizard~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_WIZARD]
TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC	TAG_LEVEL_BONUSES			Saving Throws	Generally, when you are subject to an unusual or magical attack, you get a saving throw to avoid or reduce the effect.  Like an ~attack roll~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL], a saving throw is a d20 roll plus a bonus based on your ~class~[TAG_CLASSES], level and ~ability score~[TAG_ABILITY_SCORES].  Your saving throw modifier is:                          ~base save bonus~[TAG_LEVEL_BONUSES] + ~ability modifier~[TAG_ABILITY_MODIFIERS]There are three different kinds of saving throws:                                ~Fortitude~[TAG_FORTITUDE], ~Reflex~[TAG_REFLEX], and ~Will~[TAG_WILL]Saving Throw Difficulty Class: The DC for a save is determined by the attack itself.  For example, a Small Centipede's ~poison~[TAG_POISON] allows a DC 11 Fortitude save against it.Automatic Failures and Successes: A natural 1 on a saving throw is always a failure.  A natural 20 is always a success.
TAG_FORTITUDE	TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC			Fortitude	These saves measure your ability to stand up to massive physical punishment or attacks against your vitality and health.

TAG_CLASS_BENEFITS	TAG_CLASSES			Level-Dependent Benefits	Characters gain benefits from advancing in levels, in addition to those gained from their ~class and level bonuses~[TAG_LEVEL_BONUSES]. Maximum Skill Ranks: A character's level determines the maximum allowable ranks he or she may have in Class ~Skills~[TAG_SKILLS] and Cross-Class Skills. The maximum ranks in Class Skills is the level plus 3, while the maximum level for Cross-Class Skills is half of that.Feats: A character receives one ~feat~[TAG_FEATS] at 1st level and another at every level divisible by three after that (3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th). These feats are in addition to any bonus feats granted as ~class features~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_DESC].Ability Score Increase: Upon attaining any level divisible by four (4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 20th), a character increases one of his or her ~ability scores~[TAG_ABILITY_SCORES] by 1 point. The player chooses which ability score to improve.
TAG_EXPERIENCE_AND_LEVELS	TAG_CLASSES			Experience and Levels	Experience points (XP) measure how much your character has learned and how much he or she has grown in personal power. Your character earns XP by defeating monsters and completing quests. When your character's XP total reaches at least the minimum XP needed for a new character level (see ~Class Benefits~[TAG_CLASS_BENEFITS]), he or she "goes up a level". Characters can only go up one level at a time.Below are the point totals needed to attain a given character level--that is, the total of all the character's levels in classes:Level     @tXP1st       @t02nd     @t1,0003rd      @t3,0004th      @t6,0005th     @t10,0006th     @t15,0007th     @t21,0008th     @t28,0009th     @t36,00010th     @t45,00011th       @t55,00012th     @t66,00013th      @t78,00014th      @t91,00015th     @t105,00016th     @t120,00017th     @t136,00018th     @t153,00019th     @t171,00020th    @t190,000
TAG_MULTICLASS	TAG_CLASSES			Multiclass Characters	When a character advances a level, he or she may choose to advance in a different ~class~[TAG_CLASSES] than the original class selected. Once a character has two or more different classes, that character is said to be a multiclass character.Characters gain ~abilities~[TAG_ABILITIES] and ~features~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_DESC] according to their new class, but their overall level remains the combined total of all their levels. Thus, a 7th level ~cleric~[TAG_CLERICS]/1st level ~barbarian~[TAG_BARBARIANS] is said to be an 8th level character.A multiclass character receives a 20% experience point reduction penalty for each class that is not within 2 levels of his highest class. Note that a character's ~favored class~[TAG_FAVORED_CLASS] (dependent upon ~race~[TAG_RACES]) does not count as the highest level.
TAG_FAVORED_CLASS	TAG_CLASSES			Favored Class	A character's favored ~class~[TAG_CLASSES] does not count against him or her when determining experience point penalties for ~multiclassing~[TAG_MULTICLASS]. For example, as a ~halfling~[TAG_HALFLINGS] ~rogue~[TAG_ROGUES], Lidda can add a second class later on (becoming a multiclass character) without worrying about an XP penalty, because rogue is the favored class for halflings. Note that ~humans~[TAG_HUMANS] and ~half-elves~[TAG_HALF_ELVES] do not have a favored class. Instead their highest-level class, whatever it may be, is not counted when determining if there is an experience point penalty for that character.
TAG_BARBARIANS	TAG_CLASSES			Barbarians	From the frozen wastes of the north and the hellish jungles of the south come brave, even reckless warriors. Civilized people call them barbarians or berserkers and suspect them of mayhem, impiety, and atrocities. These "barbarians" have proven their mettle and their value to those who would be their allies.Characteristics: The barbarian is an excellent warrior. Where the ~fighter's~[TAG_FIGHTERS] skill in combat comes from training and discipline, however, the barbarian has a powerful rage. Barbarians are at home in the wild and they run at great speed.Alignment: Barbarians are never lawful. They may be honorable, but at heart they are wild. This wildness is their strength, and it could not live in a lawful soul. At best, barbarians of chaotic alignment are free and expressive. At worst, they are thoughtlessly destructive.Religion: Some barbarians distrust established religions and prefer an intuitive, natural relationship to the cosmos over formal worship. Others devote themselves to powerful deities, such as ~Kord~[TAG_KORD] (the god of strength), ~Obad-Hai~[TAG_OBAD_HAI] (the god of nature), or ~Erythnul~[TAG_ERYTHNUL] (the god of slaughter).Other Classes: As people of the wild, barbarians are most comfortable in the company of ~rangers~[TAG_RANGERS], ~druids~[TAG_DRUIDS], and ~clerics~[TAG_CLERICS] of nature deities. Many barbarians admire the talents of ~bards~[TAG_BARDS] and are enthusiastic about music. However, barbarians don't trust what they don't understand, which includes the practices of ~wizards~[TAG_WIZARDS]. They are more tolerant toward ~sorcerers~[TAG_SORCERERS], perhaps because sorcerers are so charismatic. Barbarians have little in common with the practical, deliberate approach to combat that ~monks~[TAG_MONKS] take, but these two classes are not necessarily hostile to one another. Barbarians have no special attitude toward fighters, ~paladins~[TAG_PALADINS], clerics, or ~rogues~[TAG_ROGUES].Role: A barbarian's typical primary role in a group of adventurers is as a front-line combat specialist. No other character can match a barbarian's sheer toughness. He can also serve as a good scout, thanks to his speed, skill selection, and trap sense.Abilities: ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH] is important for barbarians because of its role in combat. ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] is also useful to barbarians, especially those who wear light armor. ~Wisdom~[TAG_WISDOM] is important for several of the barbarian's class skills. A high ~Constitution~[TAG_CONSTITUTION] score lets a barbarian rage longer.Class Alignment: Any nonlawfulHit Die: d12Base Attack and Base Save Bonuses: see ~table~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARBARIAN]Class Skills: ~Intimidate~[TAG_INTIMIDATE], ~Listen~[TAG_LISTEN], and ~Survival~[TAG_SURVIVAL]Skill points at 1st Level: (4 + ~Int~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE] modifier) x 4Skill points at Each Additional Level: 4 + Int modifierClass Features:[CMD_CHILDREN]
TAG_BARDS	TAG_CLASSES			Bards	It is said that music has a special magic, and the bard proves that saying true. Wandering across the land, gathering lore, telling stories, working magic with his music, and living on the gratitude of his audience--such is the life of a bard. When change or opportunity draws them into a conflict, bards serve as diplomats, negotiators, scouts, and spies.Characteristics: A bard brings forth magic from his soul, not from a book. He can cast only a small number of spells, but he can do so without selecting or preparing them in advance. His magic emphasizes charms and illusions over the more dramatic evocation spells that ~wizards~[TAG_WIZARDS] and ~sorcerers~[TAG_SORCERERS] often use. In addition to spells, a bard works magic with his music and poetry. He can encourage allies, hold his audiences rapt, and counter magical effects that rely on speech or sound. Bards have some of the same skills as ~rogues~[TAG_ROGUES]. A bard listens to stories as well as telling them, of course, so he has a vast knowledge of local events and noteworthy items.Alignment: Bards are wanderers, guided by whim and intuition rather than by tradition or law. The spontaneous talent, magic, and lifestyle of the bard are incompatible with a lawful alignment.Other Classes: A bard works well with companions of other classes. He often serves as the spokesperson of the party, using his social skills for the party's benefit. In a party without a wizard or sorcerer, the bard contributes magic. In a party without a rogue, bards use their skills.Role: The bard is perhaps the ultimate generalist. In most adventuring groups, he works best in a supporting role. The bard makes all the other characters better at what they do, and can often fill in for another character when needed.Abilities: ~Charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA] determines how powerful a spell a bard can cast, how many spells he can cast per day, and how hard those spells are to resist. Charisma, ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY], and ~Intelligence~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE] are important for many of the bard's class skills.Class Alignment: Any nonlawfulHit Die: d6Base Attack and Base Save Bonuses: see ~table~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD]Class Skills: ~Appraise~[TAG_APPRAISE], ~Bluff~[TAG_BLUFF], ~Concentration~[TAG_CONCENTRATION], ~Diplomacy~[TAG_DIPLOMACY], ~Gather Information~[TAG_GATHER_INFORMATION], ~Hide~[TAG_HIDE], ~Listen~[TAG_LISTEN], ~Move Silently~[TAG_MOVE_SILENTLY], ~Perform~[TAG_PERFORM], ~Sense Motive~[TAG_SENSE_MOTIVE], ~Sleight of Hand~[TAG_SLEIGHT], ~Spellcraft~[TAG_SPELLCRAFT], and ~Use Magic Device~[TAG_UMD]Skill Points at 1st Level: (6 + Int modifier) x 4Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 6 + Int modifierClass Features:[CMD_CHILDREN]
TAG_CLERICS	TAG_CLASSES			Clerics	The handiwork of the gods is everywhere--in places of natural beauty, in mighty crusades, in soaring temples, and in the hearts of worshipers. Like people, gods can run the gamut from benevolent to malicious, reserved to intrusive, simple to inscrutable. The gods, however, work mostly through intermediaries--their clerics. Good clerics heal, protect, and avenge. Evil clerics pillage, destroy, and sabotage.Characteristics: Clerics are masters of ~divine magic~[TAG_DIVINE_SPELLS], a form of magic that is especially good with healing.Alignment: Like the gods they serve, clerics can be of any alignment. Because people more readily worship good deities than neutral or evil ones, there are more good than evil clerics. Clerics also tend toward law instead of chaos, since lawful religions tend to be more structured and better able to recruit and train clerics than chaotic ones. Typically, a cleric is the same alignment as his or her deity, though some clerics are one step away from their respective deities in alignment.Other Classes: In an adventuring party, the cleric is everybody's friend and often the glue that holds the party together, as well as the healer who channels divine energy to keep others alive. Clerics sometimes clash with ~druids~[TAG_DRUIDS], since druids represent an older, more primal relationship between the mortal and the divine. Mostly, though, the religion of a cleric and the god that he worships determines how he gets along with others.Role: The cleric serves as a typical group's primary healer, diviner, and defensive specialist. Clerics can hold their own in a fight, but are not usually well served by charging to the front of combat.Abilities: ~Wisdom~[TAG_WISDOM] determines how powerful a spell a cleric can cast, how many spells he can cast per day, and how hard those spells are to resist. A high ~Constitution~[TAG_CONSTITUTION] score improves a cleric's ~hit points~[TAG_HIT_POINTS], and a high ~Charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA] score improves his ability to turn or rebuke undead.Class Alignment: A cleric's ~alignment~[TAG_ALIGNMENT] must be within one step of his ~deity's~[TAG_RELIGION].Hit Die: d8Base Attack and Base Save Bonuses: see ~table~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_CLERIC]Class Skills: ~Concentration~[TAG_CONCENTRATION], ~Diplomacy~[TAG_DIPLOMACY], ~Heal~[TAG_HEAL], and ~Spellcraft~[TAG_SPELLCRAFT]Domains: Clerics must select two ~domains~[TAG_DOMAINS] from their deity's list. A cleric who chooses the ~Travel domain~[TAG_TRAVEL_D] adds ~Survival~[TAG_SURVIVAL] to his class skill list. A cleric who chooses the ~Trickery domain~[TAG_TRICKERY_D] adds ~Bluff~[TAG_BLUFF] and ~Hide~[TAG_HIDE] to his class skill list.Skill Points at 1st Level: (2 + ~Int~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE] modifier) x 4Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 2 + Int modifierClass Features:[CMD_CHILDREN]
TAG_DRUIDS	TAG_CLASSES			Druids	The fury of a storm, the gentle strength of the morning sun, the cunning of the fox, the power of the bear--all these and more are at the druid's command. The druid, however, claims no mastery over nature. That claim, she says, is the empty boast of a city dweller. The druid gains her power not by ruling nature but by being at one with it. To a trespasser in a druid's sacred grove, and to those who feel her wrath, the distinction is overly fine.Characteristics: Druids cast ~divine spells~[TAG_DIVINE_SPELLS] much the same way ~clerics~[TAG_CLERICS] do, though most get their spells from the power of nature rather than from deities. In addition to spells, druids gain an increasing array of magical powers, including the ability to take the shapes of animals, as they advance in level.Alignment: Druids, in keeping with nature's ultimate indifference, must maintain at least some measure of dispassion. As such, they must be neutral on at least one alignment axis (chaotic-lawful or good-evil), if not both.Other Classes: The druid shares with ~rangers~[TAG_RANGERS] and many ~barbarians~[TAG_BARBARIANS] a reverence for nature and a familiarity with natural lands. She doesn't really understand the urban mannerisms of a ~rogue~[TAG_ROGUES] and finds ~arcane magic~[TAG_ARCANE_SPELLS] disruptive. The typical druid also dislikes the ~paladin's~[TAG_PALADINS] devotion to abstract ideals instead of "the real world". However, most druids accept diversity and, as such, take little offense to other characters.Role: The druid enjoys extraordinary versatility, using her offensive spells and wild shape ability to a party's advantage.Abilities: ~Wisdom~[TAG_WISDOM] determines how powerful a spell a druid can cast, how many spells she can cast per day, and how hard those spells are to resist. To cast a spell, a druid must have a Wisdom score of: 11 + the spell's level     A druid gets bonus spells based on Wisdom. The Difficulty Class of a ~saving throw~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC] against a druid's spell is: 11 + the druid's Wisdom modifier     Since a druid wears only light or medium armor, a high ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] score greatly improves her defensive ability.Class Alignment: ~Neutral Good~[TAG_NEUTRAL_GOOD], ~Lawful Neutral~[TAG_LAWFUL_NEUTRAL], ~True Neutral~[TAG_NEUTRAL], ~Chaotic Neutral~[TAG_CHAOTIC_NEUTRAL], or ~Neutral Evil~[TAG_NEUTRAL_EVIL]Hit Die: d8Base Attack and Base Save Bonuses: see ~table~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_DRUID]Class Skills: ~Concentration~[TAG_CONCENTRATION], ~Diplomacy~[TAG_DIPLOMACY], ~Heal~[TAG_HEAL], ~Listen~[TAG_LISTEN], ~Spellcraft~[TAG_SPELLCRAFT], ~Spot~[TAG_SPOT], and ~Survival~[TAG_SURVIVAL]Skill Points at 1st Level: (4 + ~Int~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE] modifier) x 4Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 4 + Int modifierClass Features:[CMD_CHILDREN]
TAG_FIGHTERS	TAG_CLASSES			Fighters	The questing knight, the conquering overlord, the king's champion, the elite foot soldier, the hardened mercenary, and the bandit king--all are fighters. Fighters can be stalwart defenders of those in need, cruel marauders, or gutsy adventurers. Some are among the land's best souls, willing to face death for the greater good. Others are among the worst, with no qualms about killing for private gain, or even for sport. Fighters who are not actively adventuring may be soldiers, guards, bodyguards, champions, or criminal enforcers.Characteristics: Fighters are familiar with all the standard weapons and armors and also develop particular weapon and fighting specialties of their own.Other Classes: The fighter excels in a straight fight, but he or she relies on others for magical support, healing and scouting. On a team, it is a fighter's job to man the front lines, protect the other party members and bring the tough opponents down.Role: In most adventuring parties, the fighter serves as a melee combatant, charging into the fray while his comrades support him with spells, ranged attacks and other effects. Fighters who favor ranged combat can prove very deadly, although without other melee support they can find themselves in front-line combat more often than they might prefer.Abilities: ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH] is especially important for fighters because it improves their melee ~attack~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL] and damage rolls. ~Constitution~[TAG_CONSTITUTION] is important for giving fighters many ~hit points~[TAG_HIT_POINTS], which they need in their frequent battles. ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] is important for fighters who want to be good archers or who want access to certain Dexterity-oriented feats, but the heavy armor that fighters usually wear reduces the benefits of a very high Dexterity score.Class Alignment: AnyHit Die: d10Base Attack and Base Save Bonuses: see ~table~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_FIGHTER]Class Skills: ~Intimidate~[TAG_INTIMIDATE]Skill Points at 1st Level: (2 + ~Int~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE] modifier) x 4Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 2 + Int modifierClass Features:[CMD_CHILDREN]
TAG_MONKS	TAG_CLASSES			Monks	Dotted across the landscape are monasteries--small, walled cloisters inhabited by monks who pursue personal perfection through action as well as contemplation. They train themselves to be versatile warriors skilled at fighting without weapons or armor. The inhabitants of monasteries headed by good masters serve as protectors of the people. In contrast, the residents of monasteries headed by evil masters rule the surrounding lands through fear, as an evil warlord and his entourage might.Characteristics: The key feature of the monk is her ability to fight unarmed and unarmored. Though a monk casts no spells, she has a magic of her own, called ki, which allows her to perform amazing feats. The monk's best known ~feat~[TAG_STUNNING_FIST] is her ability to stun an opponent with an unarmed blow.Alignment: Any lawful. A monk's training requires strict discipline. Only those who are lawful at heart are capable of undertaking it.Other Classes: Monks do not have much in common with others, as their skills and motivation differ from those of most adventurers. However, monks realize that they work well with the support of others and they usually prove themselves reliable companions.Role: The monk functions best as an opportunistic combatant, using her speed to get into and out of combat quickly, rather than engaging in prolonged melees.Abilities: ~Wisdom~[TAG_WISDOM] powers the monk's special offensive and defensive capabilities. ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] provides an unarmored monk with a better defense and with bonuses to some class skills. ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH] helps a monk's unarmed combat ability.Class Alignment: ~Lawful Good~[TAG_LAWFUL_GOOD], ~Lawful Neutral~[TAG_LAWFUL_NEUTRAL], or ~Lawful Evil~[TAG_LAWFUL_EVIL]Hit Die: d8Base Attack and Base Save Bonuses: see ~table~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MONK]Class Skills: ~Concentration~[TAG_CONCENTRATION],~Diplomacy~[TAG_DIPLOMACY], ~Hide~[TAG_HIDE], ~Listen~[TAG_LISTEN], ~Move Silently~[TAG_MOVE_SILENTLY], ~Perform~[TAG_PERFORM], ~Sense Motive~[TAG_SENSE_MOTIVE], ~Spot~[TAG_SPOT], and ~Tumble~[TAG_TUMBLE]Skill Points at 1st Level: (4 + ~Int~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE] modifier) x 4Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 4 + Int modifierClass Features:[CMD_CHILDREN]Like a member of any other class, a monk may be a ~multiclass~[TAG_MULTICLASS] character, but multiclass monks face a special restriction. A monk who gains a new class or (if already multiclass) raises another class by a level may never again raise her monk level, though she retains all her monk abilities.
TAG_PALADINS	TAG_CLASSES			Paladins	The compassion to pursue good, the will to uphold law, and the power to defeat evil--these are the three weapons of the paladin. Few have the purity and devotion that it takes to walk the paladin's path, but those few are rewarded with the power to protect, to heal, and to smite. In a land of scheming ~wizards~[TAG_WIZARDS], unholy priests, bloodthirsty dragons, and infernal fiends, the paladin is the final hope that cannot be extinguished.Characteristics: Divine power protects the paladin and gives her special powers. It wards off harm, protects her from disease, lets her heal herself and heal others, as well. A paladin can use this power to destroy evil.Alignment: Paladins must be lawful good. They lose their divine powers if they deviate from that alignment.Other Classes: Paladins work well with other classes, particularly when members of the group are committed to good. Their only conflicts arise in regards to evil characters or evil acts.Role: The paladin's chief role is as a melee combatant, but they also work well as a secondary healer within a group, or as a charismatic party leader.Abilities: ~Charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA] enhances a paladin's healing power, self-protective capabilities, and turn undead ability. ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH] is important for the paladin because of its role in combat. A ~Wisdom~[TAG_WISDOM] score of 14 or higher is required to get access to the most powerful paladin spells, and a score of 11 or higher is required to cast any paladin spells at all.Class Alignment: ~Lawful Good~[TAG_LAWFUL_GOOD]Hit Die: d10Base Attack and Base Save Bonuses: see ~table~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_PALADIN]Class Skills: ~Concentration~[TAG_CONCENTRATION], ~Diplomacy~[TAG_DIPLOMACY], ~Heal~[TAG_HEAL], and ~Sense Motive~[TAG_SENSE_MOTIVE]Skill Points at 1st Level: (2 + ~Int~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE] modifier) x 4Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 2 + Int modifierClass Features:[CMD_CHILDREN]Like a member of any other class, a paladin may be a ~multiclass~[TAG_MULTICLASS] character, but multiclass paladins face a special restriction. A paladin who gains a level in any class other than paladin may never again raise her paladin level, though she retains all her paladin abilities.
TAG_RANGERS	TAG_CLASSES			Rangers	The forests are home to fierce and cunning creatures, such as bloodthirsty owlbears and malicious displacer beasts. But more cunning and powerful than these monsters is the ranger, a skilled hunter and stalker. He knows the woods as if they were his home (as indeed they are), and he knows his prey in deadly detail.Characteristics: A ranger can use a variety of weapons and is quite capable in combat. A ranger's skills allow him to survive in the wilderness, and he possesses special knowledge about certain creatures. Finally, an experienced ranger has such a tie to nature that he can actually draw upon natural power to cast ~divine spells~[TAG_DIVINE_SPELLS], as a ~druid~[TAG_DRUIDS] does.Alignment: Most rangers are good, and they usually function as protectors of natural areas. They are also typically chaotic, preferring to follow the ebb and flow of nature or of their own hearts instead of rigid rules. Evil rangers are much to be feared as they gain spells to use nature for destructive purposes.Other Classes: Rangers get along well with druids and to some extent with ~barbarians~[TAG_BARBARIANS]. They bicker most often with ~paladins~[TAG_PALADINS], who have a different style and approach to life that is much more bound by a code of morals and laws. Typically, though, rangers easily tolerate others, mostly because they don't feel the need to get upset over differences.Role: The ranger's best role is that of a scout and secondary combatant, often focusing on opportunistic and ranged attacks.Abilities: ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] is important for a ranger both because he tends to wear light armor and because several ranger skills are based on that ability. ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH] is important because rangers frequently get involved in combat. Several ranger skills are based on ~Wisdom~[TAG_WISDOM], and a Wisdom score of 14 or higher is required to get access to the most powerful ranger spells. A Wisdom score of 11 or higher is required to cast any ranger spells at all. One of the ranger's trademark skills, his ability to ~track~[TAG_TRACK] foes, is based on Wisdom.Class Alignment: AnyHit Die: d8Base Attack and Base Save Bonuses: see ~table~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_RANGER]Class Skills: ~Concentration~[TAG_CONCENTRATION], ~Heal~[TAG_HEAL], ~Hide~[TAG_HIDE], ~Listen~[TAG_LISTEN], ~Move Silently~[TAG_MOVE_SILENTLY], ~Search~[TAG_SEARCH], ~Spot~[TAG_SPOT], and ~Survival~[TAG_SURVIVAL]Skill Points at 1st Level: (6 + ~Int~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE] modifier) x 4Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 6 + Int modifierClass Features:[CMD_CHILDREN]
TAG_ROGUES	TAG_CLASSES			Rogues	Rogues have little in common with one another. Some are stealthy thieves. Others are silver-tongued tricksters. Still others are scouts, infiltrators, spies, diplomats, or thugs. What they do share is versatility, adaptability, and resourcefulness. In general, rogues are skilled at getting what others don't want them to get: entrance into a locked treasure vault, safe passage past a deadly trap, secret battle plans, a guard's trust, or some random person's pocket moneyCharacteristics: Rogues are highly skilled and they can concentrate on developing any of several categories of skills. A rogue knows how to hit where it hurts and she can dish out a lot of damage with a sneak attack.Alignment: Rogues follow opportunities, not ideals. Though they are more likely to be chaotic than lawful, they are a diverse bunch, so they can be of any alignment.Other Classes: Rogues excel when protected by warriors and spellcasters, but they are wary of the sometimes overbearing disposition of ~paladins~[TAG_PALADINS].Role: The rogue's role in a group can vary dramatically based on her skill selection, but most rogues share certain aspects. They aren't capable of prolonged melee combat, so they focus on opportunistic sneak attacks or ranged attacks. The rogue's stealth and trapfinding ability make her one of the best scouts in the game.Abilities: ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] provides extra protection for the lightly armored rogue. ~Intelligence~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE] and ~Wisdom~[TAG_WISDOM] are important for many of the rogue's skills. A high Intelligence score also gives the rogue extra skill points, which can be used to expand her repertoire.Class Alignment: AnyHit Die: d6Base Attack and Base Save Bonuses: see ~table~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE]Class Skills: ~Appraise~[TAG_APPRAISE], ~Bluff~[TAG_BLUFF], ~Diplomacy~[TAG_DIPLOMACY], ~Disable Device~[TAG_DISABLE_DEVICE], ~Gather Information~[TAG_GATHER_INFORMATION], ~Hide~[TAG_HIDE], ~Intimidate~[TAG_INTIMIDATE], ~Listen~[TAG_LISTEN], ~Move Silently~[TAG_MOVE_SILENTLY], ~Open Lock~[TAG_OPEN_LOCK], ~Perform~[TAG_PERFORM], ~Search~[TAG_SEARCH], ~Sense Motive~[TAG_SENSE_MOTIVE], ~Sleight of Hand~[TAG_SLEIGHT], ~Spot~[TAG_SPOT], ~Tumble~[TAG_TUMBLE], and ~Use Magic Device~[TAG_UMD]Skill Points at 1st Level: (8 + Int modifier) x 4Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 8 + Int modifierClass Features:[CMD_CHILDREN]
TAG_SORCERERS	TAG_CLASSES			Sorcerers	Sorcerers create magic the way a poet creates poems, with inborn talent honed by practice. They have no books, no theories, no mentors--just raw power that they direct at will. Some sorcerers claim that the blood of dragons courses through their veins. This claim may be true in some cases, although many hold that the claim is either an unsubstantiated boast or envious gossip.Characteristics: Sorcerers cast spells through innate power rather than through careful training and study. Their magic is intuitive rather than logical. They can cast spells more often than ~wizards~[TAG_WIZARDS] and have no need to select and prepare their spells ahead of time.Alignment: Sorcery favors the free, chaotic, creative spirit over the disciplined mind, so sorcerers tend slightly towards chaos over law. Otherwise, sorcerer alignment varies considerably.Other Classes: Sorcerers find that they have the most in common with members of other largely self-taught classes, such as ~druids~[TAG_DRUIDS] and ~rogues~[TAG_ROGUES]. They sometimes find themselves at odds with members of the more disciplined classes, such as ~paladins~[TAG_PALADINS] and ~monks~[TAG_MONKS]. Since they cast the same spells as wizards do but do so in a different way, they sometimes find themselves in competition with wizards.Role: A sorcerer tends to define his role based on spell selection. A sorcerer who focuses on damage-dealing spells becomes the center of the party's offensive power, while another sorcerer that relies on charms or illusions will take a quieter role. A party with a sorcerer should strongly consider a second spellcaster to make up for the sorcerer's lack of versatility. Since sorcerers rely on their charismatic presence when interacting with others, they often serve as the "face" for an adventuring party.Abilities: ~Charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA] determines how powerful a spell a sorcerer can cast, how many spells he can cast per day, and how hard those spells are to resist. Like a wizard, a sorcerer benefits from high ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] and ~Constitution~[TAG_CONSTITUTION] scores.Class Alignment: AnyHit Die: d4Base Attack and Base Save Bonuses: see ~table~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_SORCERER]Class Skills: ~Bluff~[TAG_BLUFF], ~Concentration~[TAG_CONCENTRATION], and ~Spellcraft~[TAG_SPELLCRAFT]Skill Points at 1st Level: (2 + ~Int~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE] modifier) x 4Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 2 + Int modifierClass Features:[CMD_CHILDREN]
TAG_WIZARDS	TAG_CLASSES			Wizards	A few unintelligible words and fleeting gestures carry more power than a battleaxe, when they are the words and gestures of a wizard. These simple acts make magic seem easy, but they only hint at the time the wizard must spend poring over his spellbook preparing each spell for casting, and the years before that spent in apprenticeship to learn the arts of magic. For wizards, magic is not a talent but a difficult, rewarding art.Characteristics: The wizard's strength is his spells. Everything else is secondary. He learns new spells as he explores and grows in experience.     Some wizards prefer to specialize in a certain type of magic. ~Specialization~[TAG_CHARGEN_WIZARD_SPECIALIZATION] makes a wizard more powerful in his chosen field, but it denies him access to some of the spells that lie outside that field.     Like a ~sorcerer~[TAG_SORCERERS], a wizard can call a familiar--a small, magical animal companion that serves him.Alignment: Overall, wizards show a slight tendency toward law over chaos because the study of magic rewards those who are disciplined. Illusionists and transmuters, however, are masters of deception and change, respectively. They favor chaos over law.Other Classes: Wizards prefer to work with members of other classes. They love to cast their spells from behind strong ~fighters~[TAG_FIGHTERS], to "magic up" ~rogues~[TAG_ROGUES] and send them out to scout, and to rely on the divine healing of ~clerics~[TAG_CLERICS]. They may find members of certain classes (such as sorcerers, rogues, and ~bards~[TAG_BARDS]) to be not quite serious enough, but they're not judgmental.Role: The wizard's role depends somewhat on his spell selection, but most wizards share certain similarities in function. They are among the most offensively minded of the spellcasting classes, with a broad range of options available for neutralizing enemies.Abilities: ~Intelligence~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE] determines how powerful a spell a wizard can cast, how many spells he can cast per day, and how hard those spells are to resist. A high ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] score is helpful for a wizard, who typically wears little or no armor, because it provides him with a bonus to ~Armor Class~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS]. A good ~Constitution~[TAG_CONSTITUTION] score gives a wizard extra ~hit points~[TAG_HIT_POINTS], a resource he is otherwise very low on.Class Alignment: AnyHit Die: d4Base Attack and Base Save Bonuses: see ~table~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_WIZARD]Class Skills: ~Concentration~[TAG_CONCENTRATION] and ~Spellcraft~[TAG_SPELLCRAFT]Skill Points at 1st Level: (2 + Int modifier) x 4Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 2 + Int modifierClass Features:[CMD_CHILDREN]
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_DESC	TAG_LEVEL_BONUSES			Class Features	Class features are special characteristics that belong exclusively to that class.  When applicable, restrictions and disadvantages will also be described.  Class features include aspects such as Weapon and Armor Proficiency, special skills, or spells.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARBARIAN_DAMAGE_REDUCTION	TAG_BARBARIANS			Damage Reduction	At 7th level, a barbarian gains the ability to shrug off some amount of injury from each blow or attack.  1 point of damage is subtracted each time a barbarian is dealt damage from a weapon or natural attack.  At 10th level, the damage reduction rises by 1 point, so 2 points of damage total is subtracted at that level.  Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARBARIAN_FAST_MOVEMENT	TAG_BARBARIANS			Fast Movement	A barbarian's land speed is faster than the norm for his race by +10 feet.  This benefit applies only when he is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load.  Apply this bonus before modifying the barbarian's speed because of any load carried or armor worn.     For example, a ~human~[TAG_HUMANS] barbarian has a speed of 40 feet, rather than 30 feet, when wearing light or no armor.  When wearing medium armor or carrying a medium load, his speed drops to 30 feet.     A ~halfling~[TAG_HALFLINGS] barbarian has a speed of 30 feet, rather than 20 feet, in light or no armor.  When wearing medium armor or carrying a medium load, his speed drops to 20 feet.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARBARIAN_IMPROVED_UNCANNY_DODGE	TAG_BARBARIANS			Improved Uncanny Dodge	At 5th level and higher, a barbarian can no longer be ~flanked~[TAG_FLANKING]; he can react to opponents on opposite sides of him as easily as he can react to a single attacker.  This defense denies a ~rogue~[TAG_ROGUES] the ability to ~sneak attack~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_SNEAK_ATTACK] the barbarian by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has barbarian levels.     If a character already has ~uncanny dodge~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_UNCANNY_DODGE] from a second class, the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead, and the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARBARIAN_RAGE	TAG_BARBARIANS			Rage	A barbarian can fly into a screaming blood frenzy a certain number of times per day.  In rage, a barbarian gains phenomenal strength and durability but becomes reckless and less able to defend himself.  He temporarily gains a +4 bonus to ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH], a +4 bonus to ~Constitution~[TAG_CONSTITUTION], and a +2 morale bonus on ~Will~[TAG_WILL] saves, but he takes a -2 to ~AC~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS].     The Constitution bonus increases the barbarian's ~hit points~[TAG_HIT_POINTS] by 2 points per level, but these hit points disappear once the rage ends, at which point his Constitution score drops back to normal.     While raging, a barbarian cannot use skills or abilities that require patience or concentration (such as casting a spell or moving silently).  He can use any feat he may have except for ~Combat Expertise~[TAG_COMBAT_EXPERTISE], ~item creation feats~[TAG_ITEM_CREATION], ~metamagic feats~[TAG_METAMAGIC], and ~Skill Focus~[TAG_SKILL_FOCUS].     A fit of rage lasts for the number of rounds equal to 3 + the character's newly improved Constitution modifier.  At the end of the rage, the barbarian loses the rage modifiers and becomes ~fatigued~[TAG_FATIGUED] (-2 penalty to Strength, -2 penalty to ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY], cannot ~charge~[TAG_CHARGE] or ~run~[TAG_RUN]) for the same number of rounds as the rage lasted.     A barbarian can fly into a fit of rage only once per encounter.  At 1st level, he can use his rage ability once per day.  At 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter, he can use it one additional time per day.  Entering a rage can only be done during the barbarian's action, not in response to someone else's action.  For example, a barbarian can't fly into a rage when struck by an arrow just to get the extra hit points from the Constitution bonus.  Those extra hit points would only be helpful if the barbarian initiated a rage before being struck.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARBARIAN_TRAP_SENSE	TAG_BARBARIANS			Trap Sense	Starting at 3rd level, a barbarian has an intuitive sense that alerts him to danger from traps, giving him a +1 bonus on ~Reflex~[TAG_REFLEX] saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to ~AC~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS] against attacks made by traps.  These bonuses rise by +1 every three barbarian levels thereafter.  Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARBARIAN_UNCANNY_DODGE	TAG_BARBARIANS			Uncanny Dodge	At 2nd level, a barbarian gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so.  He retains his ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] bonus to ~AC~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS] (if any) even if he is caught ~flat-footed~[TAG_FLAT_FOOTED] or struck by an ~invisible~[TAG_INVISIBLE] attacker.  However, he still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARBARIAN_WEAPON_ARMOR_PROF	TAG_BARBARIANS			Weapon and Armor Proficiency	A barbarian is proficient with all ~simple~[TAG_SIMPLE_WEAPONS] and ~martial~[TAG_MARTIAL_WEAPONS] weapons, ~light~[TAG_ARMOR_LIGHT] armor, ~medium~[TAG_ARMOR_MEDIUM] armor, and ~shields~[TAG_ARMOR_SHIELD].

TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_BARDIC_KNOWLEDGE	TAG_BARDS			Bardic Knowledge	A bard picks up a lot of stray knowledge while wandering the land and learning stories from other bards.  He may make a special bardic knowledge check with a bonus equal to his bard level + his ~Intelligence~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE] modifier to see whether he knows some relevant information about local notable people, legendary items, or noteworthy places.     A successful bardic knowledge check will not reveal the powers of a ~magic item~[TAG_MAGIC_ITEMS] but may give a hint as to its general function.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_BARDIC_MUSIC	TAG_BARDS			Bardic Music	Once per day per bard level, a bard can use her song or poetics to produce magical effects on those around her (including herself, if desired).  While these abilities fall under the category of bardic music and include descriptions of singing or playing instruments, they can all also be activated by reciting poetry, chanting, singing lyrics or melodies, etc.  Each ability requires both a minimum bard level and a minimum number of ranks in the ~Perform~[TAG_PERFORM] skill to qualify.     Starting a bardic music effect is a ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION].  Some bardic music abilities require concentration, which means the bard must take a standard action each round to maintain the ability.  While using bardic music, a bard can fight but cannot cast spells, activate ~magic items~[TAG_MAGIC_ITEMS] by spell completion (such as scrolls), or activate magic items by magic word (such as wands).  All are mind-affecting abilities.     See ~Countersong~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_COUNTERSONG], ~Fascinate~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_FASCINATE], ~Inspire Courage~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_INSPIRE_COURAGE], ~Inspire Competence~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_INSPIRE_COMPETENCE], and ~Inspire Greatness~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_INSPIRE_GREATNESS] for descriptions of the different types of bardic musical abilities.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_COUNTERSONG	TAG_BARDS			Countersong	 A bard with 3 or more ranks in a ~Perform~[TAG_PERFORM] skill can use her music or poetics to counter magical effects that depend on sound (but not spells that simply have verbal components).  The bard may keep up the countersong for 10 rounds.  Each round of the countersong, she makes a Perform check.  Any creature within 30 feet of the bard (including the bard herself) that is affected by a sonic or language-dependent magical attack (such as a ~Sound Burst~[TAG_SPELLS_SOUND_BURST] or ~Command~[TAG_SPELLS_COMMAND] spell) may use the bard's Perform check result in place of its ~saving throw~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC] if, after the saving throw is rolled, the Perform check result proves to be higher.     If a creature within range of the countersong is already under the effect of a noninstantaneous sonic or language-dependent magical attack, it gains another saving throw against the effect each round it hears the countersong, but it must use the bard's Perform check result for the save.  Countersong will not influence effects that don't allow saves.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_FASCINATE	TAG_BARDS			Fascinate	 A bard with 3 or more ranks in a ~Perform~[TAG_PERFORM] skill can use his music or poetics to cause one creature to become ~fascinated~[TAG_FASCINATED].  No other action besides ~movement~[TAG_MOVEMENT_ACTION] can be executed by the bard during the round that the creature is fascinated.  The creature must be within 90 feet and able to see, hear, and pay attention to the bard.  Likewise, the bard must be able to see the creature.     To fascinate, a bard makes a Perform check.  His check result is the DC for the affected creature's ~Will~[TAG_WILL] save against the effect.  If the creature's ~saving throw~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC] is successful, a bard can still attempt to fascinate the same creature as many times as the bard's daily performance limit allows.  If the creature's saving throw fails, it sits and listens to the song for as long as the bard continues to play and concentrate (up to a max of 1 round per bard level).  While fascinated, a target takes a -4 penalty on ~skill checks~[TAG_USING_SKILLS] made as reactions (e.g. ~Listen~[TAG_LISTEN] or ~Spot~[TAG_SPOT] checks).     Any potential threat to the target, such as an ally of the bard approaching the creature, requires the bard to make another Perform check and allows the creature a new saving throw against a DC equal to the new Perform check result.  Any obvious threat to the target,  such as someone drawing a weapon or the creature taking damage, automatically breaks the effect and the creature will no longer be fascinated.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_INSPIRE_COMPETENCE	TAG_BARDS			Inspire Competence	 A bard of 4th level or higher with 7 or more ranks in a ~Perform~[TAG_PERFORM] skill can use his music or poetics to help an ally succeed at a task.  A bard cannot inspire competence in himself.  The ally must be within 30 feet and be able to see and hear the bard; likewise, the bard must be able to see the ally.  Bardic music may be used to lift the ally's spirits, to help them mentally focus, or in some other manner.  The ally gets a +2 competence bonus on ~skill checks~[TAG_USING_SKILLS] with a particular skill as long as they continue to hear the bard's music.  The effect lasts as long as the bard concentrates, up to a maximum of 2 minutes.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_INSPIRE_COURAGE	TAG_BARDS			Inspire Courage	A bard with 3 or more ranks in a ~Perform~[TAG_PERFORM] skill can use song or poetics to inspire courage in her allies (including herself), bolstering them against fear and improving their combat abilities.  To be affected, an ally must be able to hear the bard sing, and the effect lasts as long as the bard can be heard and for 5 rounds thereafter.  The ally will receive a +1 morale bonus on ~saving throws~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC] against ~charm~[TAG_CHARMED] and ~fear~[TAG_FEAR] effects and a +1 morale bonus on ~attack~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL] and weapon damage rolls.  At 8th level, and every six bard levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 1 (+2 at 8th, +3 at 14th, and +4 at 20th).
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_INSPIRE_GREATNESS	TAG_BARDS			Inspire Greatness	 A bard of 10th level or higher with 13 or more ranks in a ~Perform~[TAG_PERFORM] skill can use music or poetics to inspire greatness in himself or a single willing ally within 30 feet, granting him or her an extra fighting capability.  To inspire greatness, a bard must sing and be heard by an ally.  The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for 5 rounds thereafter.  A creature inspired with greatness gains 2 bonus Hit Dice (d10s), the commensurate number of ~temporary hit points~[TAG_TEMPORARY_HIT_POINTS] (apply the target's ~Constitution~[TAG_CONSTITUTION] modifier, if any, to these bonus Hit Dice), a +2 competence bonus on ~attack rolls~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL], and a +1 competence bonus on ~Fortitude~[TAG_FORTITUDE] saves.  The bonus Hit Dice count as regular Hit Dice for determining the effect of spells such as ~Sleep~[TAG_SPELLS_SLEEP].Note: In ToEE, a creature inspired with greatness only gains the temporary hit points.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_INTIMIDATE	TAG_DUMMY			Intimidate	A bard of 6th level or higher with 9 or more ranks in a ~Perform~[TAG_PERFORM] skill can cause a single creature to be intimidated while the creature is ~fascinated~[TAG_FASCINATED].  Using this ability does not break the bard's concentration on the fascinate effect, nor does it allow a second saving throw for the target.  The use of intimidate counts towards a bard's daily limit on performances. The creature is affected if it fails a ~Will~[TAG_WILL] ~saving throw~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC] (DC 11 + bard's ~Charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA] modifier).  If the saving throw fails, affected creatures move away from the bard as if they are victim of a ~Fear~[TAG_SPELLS_FEAR] spell for the number of rounds equal to the number of levels the bard has.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_SPELLS	TAG_BARDS			Spells	A bard casts ~arcane spells~[TAG_ARCANE_SPELLS] (the same type of spells available to ~sorcerers~[TAG_SORCERERS] and ~wizards~[TAG_WIZARDS]) which are drawn from the bard spell list.  A bard can cast any spell he or she knows without preparing for it ahead of time.  Every bard spell has a verbal component.  To learn or cast a spell, a bard must have a ~Charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA] score equal to at least:                                           10 + the spell level(Cha 10 for 0-Level spells, Cha 11 for 1st-level spells, and so forth)
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_WEAPON_ARMOR_PROF	TAG_BARDS			Weapon and Armor Proficiency	A bard is proficient with all ~simple weapons~[TAG_SIMPLE_WEAPONS], plus the ~longsword~[TAG_WEAPONS_LONGSWORD], ~rapier~[TAG_WEAPONS_RAPIER], ~sap~[TAG_WEAPONS_SAP], ~short sword~[TAG_WEAPONS_SWORD_SHORT], and ~shortbow~[TAG_WEAPONS_SHORTBOW].     Bards are proficient with ~light~[TAG_ARMOR_LIGHT] armor and ~shields~[TAG_ARMOR_SHIELD].     Because the somatic components required for bard spells are relatively simple, a bard can cast spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal ~arcane spell failure~[TAG_ARCANE_SPELL_FAILURE] chance.  However, like any other arcane spellcaster, a bard wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component (most do).  A ~multiclass~[TAG_MULTICLASS] bard still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes.[CMD_CHILDREN]

TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_CLERIC_DEITY_DOMAINS_AND_DOMAIN_SPELLS	TAG_CLERICS			Deity, Domains, and Domain Spells	Choose a ~deity~[TAG_RELIGION] for your cleric.  The cleric's deity influences his ~alignment~[TAG_ALIGNMENT], what magic he can perform, his values, and how others see him.     If the typical worshipers of a deity include the members of a specific ~race~[TAG_RACES], a cleric must be of the indicated race to choose that deity as his own.  (The god may have occasional worshipers of other races, but not clerics.)     When you have chosen an alignment and a deity for your cleric, choose two domains for the deity.  While the clerics of a particular religion are united in their reverence for their deity, each cleric emphasizes different aspects of the deity's interests.  You can select an alignment domain (~Chaos~[TAG_CHAOS_D], ~Evil~[TAG_EVIL_D], ~Good~[TAG_GOOD_DOMAIN], or ~Law~[TAG_LAW_D]) for your cleric only if his alignment matches that domain.     Each domain gives your cleric access to a domain spell at each spell level he can cast, from 1st on up, as well as a granted power.  Your cleric gets the granted powers of both the domains selected.  With access to two domain spells at a given spell level, a cleric prepares one or the other each day in his domain spell slot.  If a domain spell is not on the cleric spell list, a cleric can prepare it only in his domain spell slot.  Domain spells and granted powers are given in ~Cleric Domains~[TAG_DOMAINS].
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_CLERIC_SPELLS	TAG_CLERICS			Spells	A cleric casts ~divine spells~[TAG_DIVINE_SPELLS] (the same type of spells available to the ~druid~[TAG_DRUIDS], ~paladin~[TAG_PALADINS], and ~ranger~[TAG_RANGERS]) which are drawn from the cleric spell list.  However, a cleric's ~alignment~[TAG_ALIGNMENT] may restrict him from casting certain spells opposed to his moral or ethical beliefs.     To prepare or cast a spell, a cleric must have a ~Wisdom~[TAG_WISDOM] score equal to:                                           10 + the spell level(Wis 10 for 0-level spells, Wis 11 for 1st-level spells, and so forth)
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_CLERIC_SPONTANEOUS_CASTING	TAG_CLERICS			Spontaneous Casting	A good cleric (or a neutral cleric of a good ~deity~[TAG_RELIGION]) can channel stored spell energy into healing spells that the cleric did not prepare ahead of time.  The cleric can "lose" any prepared spell, that is not a domain spell, in order to cast a Cure spell of the same spell level.  For example, a good cleric who has prepared ~Command~[TAG_SPELLS_COMMAND] (a 1st-level spell) may lose Command in order to cast ~Cure Light Wounds~[TAG_SPELLS_CURE_LIGHT_WOUNDS] (also a 1st-level spell).  Clerics of good deities can cast Cure spells in this way because they are especially proficient at wielding positive energy.     An evil cleric (or a neutral cleric of an evil deity), on the other hand, can't convert prepared spells to Cure spells but can convert them to Inflict spells (for example, ~Inflict Light Wounds~[TAG_SPELLS_INFLICT_LIGHT_WOUNDS]).  Such clerics are especially proficient at wielding negative energy.     A cleric who is neither good nor evil and whose deity is neither good nor evil can convert spells to either Cure spells or Inflict spells (player's choice), depending on whether the cleric is more proficient at wielding positive or negative energy.  Once the player makes this choice, it cannot be reversed.  This choice also determines whether the cleric turns or rebukes undead.     Exceptions: All lawful neutral clerics of ~Wee Jas~[TAG_WEE_JAS] (the goddess of death and magic) convert prepared spells to Inflict spells, not Cure spells.  All clerics of ~St. Cuthbert~[TAG_CUTHBERT] (the god of retribution) and all nonevil clerics of ~Obad-Hai~[TAG_OBAD_HAI] (the god of nature) convert prepared spells to Cure spells, not Inflict spells.Note: To use spontaneous casting in the game, hold down the SHIFT key and select the spell you would like to cast.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_CLERIC_TURN_REBUKE_UNDEAD	TAG_CLERICS			Turn or Rebuke Undead	Any cleric, regardless of ~alignment~[TAG_ALIGNMENT], has the power to affect undead creatures (such as skeletons, zombies, ghosts, and vampires) by channeling the power of his faith through his holy (or unholy) symbol.     A good cleric (or a neutral cleric who worships a good ~deity~[TAG_RELIGION]) can turn or destroy undead creatures.     An evil cleric (or a neutral cleric who worships an evil deity) instead rebukes or commands such creatures, forcing them to ~cower~[TAG_COWERING] in awe of his power.     If your character is a neutral cleric of a neutral deity, you must choose whether his turning ability functions as that of a good cleric or an evil cleric.  Once you make this choice, it cannot be reversed.  This decision also determines whether the cleric can cast spontaneous Cure or Inflict spells.     Exceptions: All lawful neutral clerics of ~Wee Jas~[TAG_WEE_JAS] rebuke or command undead.  All clerics of ~St. Cuthbert~[TAG_CUTHBERT] and all nonevil clerics of ~Obad-Hai~[TAG_OBAD_HAI] turn or destroy undead.     A cleric may attempt to turn undead a number of times per day equal to 3 + his ~Charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA] modifier.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_CLERIC_WEAPON_ARMOR_PROF	TAG_CLERICS			Weapon and Armor Proficiency	Clerics are proficient with all ~simple weapons~[TAG_SIMPLE_WEAPONS], with all types of armor (~light~[TAG_ARMOR_LIGHT], ~medium~[TAG_ARMOR_MEDIUM], and ~heavy~[TAG_ARMOR_HEAVY]), and with ~shields~[TAG_ARMOR_SHIELD].     Every ~deity~[TAG_RELIGION] has a favored weapon, and his or her clerics consider it a point of pride to wield that weapon.  A cleric who chooses the ~War domain~[TAG_WAR_D] receives the ~Weapon Focus~[TAG_WEAPON_FOCUS] feat related to that weapon as a bonus feat.  He also receives the appropriate ~Martial Weapon Proficiency~[TAG_MARTIAL_PROF] feat as a bonus feat, if the weapon falls into that category.

TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_DRUID_ANIMAL_COMPANION	TAG_DRUIDS			Animal Companion	A druid may begin play with an animal companion that must be selected from the following list:     Attack Dog, Brown Bear, Chicken, Dire Rat, Giant Lizard, Jackal, Panda Bear, Polar Bear, or Wolf     This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures as appropriate for its species.     A druid of 4th level or higher may select from alternate lists of animals.

TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_DRUID_NATURE_SENSE	TAG_DRUIDS			Nature Sense	A druid gains a +2 bonus on ~Survival~[TAG_SURVIVAL] checks.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_DRUID_RESIST_NATURES_LURE	TAG_DRUIDS			Resist Nature's Lure	Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on ~saving throws~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC] against the spell-like abilities of fey (such as dryads, nymphs, and sprites).
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_DRUID_SPONTANEOUS_CASTING	TAG_DRUIDS			Spontaneous Casting	A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn't prepared ahead of time. She can "lose" a prepared spell in order to cast a Summon Nature's Ally spell of the same level.Note: To use spontaneous casting in the game, hold down the SHIFT key and select the spell you would like to cast.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_DRUID_TRACKLESS_STEP	TAG_DRUIDS			Trackless Step	Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked.  She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_DRUID_VENOM_IMMUNITY	TAG_DRUIDS			Venom Immunity	At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all ~poisons~[TAG_POISON].
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_DRUID_WEAPON_ARMOR_PROF	TAG_DRUIDS			Weapon and Armor Proficiency	Druids are proficient with the following weapons: ~club~[TAG_WEAPONS_CLUB], ~dagger~[TAG_WEAPONS_DAGGER], ~dart~[TAG_WEAPONS_DART], ~quarterstaff~[TAG_WEAPONS_QUARTERSTAFF], ~scimitar~[TAG_WEAPONS_SCIMITAR], ~sickle~[TAG_WEAPONS_SICKLE], ~shortspear~[TAG_WEAPONS_SHORTSPEAR], ~sling~[TAG_WEAPONS_SLING], and ~spear~[TAG_WEAPONS_SPEAR]     They are also proficient with natural attacks (~unarmed strike~[TAG_WEAPONS_STRIKE_UNARMED], claw, bite, etc.), regardless of the forms they assume.     Druids are proficient with ~light~[TAG_ARMOR_LIGHT] and ~medium~[TAG_ARMOR_MEDIUM] armor, but can only wear ~nonmetallic~[TAG_ARMOR_NONMETALLIC] armor.  They are proficient with ~shields~[TAG_ARMOR_SHIELD] but must use only wooden ones.     Druids are unable to wear prohibited armor or use a prohibited shield.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_DRUID_WILD_SHAPE	TAG_DRUIDS			Wild Shape	At 5th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into a ~Wolf~[TAG_MONSTER_WOLF] (at 5th level), ~Brown Bear~[TAG_MONSTER_BROWN_BEAR] (at 6th level), ~Legendary Rat~[TAG_MONSTER_LEGENDARY_RAT] (at 7th level), ~Polar Bear~[TAG_MONSTER_POLAR_BEAR] (at 8th level), ~Dire Lizard~[TAG_MONSTER_DIRE_LIZARD] (at 9th level), or Giant Snake (at 10th level) and back again once per day. The effects last for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back.  Changing form (to animal or back) is a ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION] and doesn't provoke an ~attack of opportunity~[TAG_AOO].     The form chosen must be that of an animal the druid is familiar with.  For example, a druid who has never been outside a temperate forest could not become a Polar Bear.     A druid loses her ability to speak while in an animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form.     A druid can use this ability more times per day at 6th, 7th, 10th, 14th, and 18th levels.  In addition, she gains the ability to take the shape of a Large animal at 8th level.  However, the new form's Hit Dice can't exceed the character's druid level.  For example at 8th level, a druid can't assume the form of a ~Dire Bear~[TAG_MONSTER_DIRE_BEAR], because although it is a Large animal, it has at least 12 Hit Dice.

TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_FIGHTER_BONUS_FEATS	TAG_FIGHTERS			Bonus Feats	At 1st level, a fighter gets a bonus combat-oriented feat in addition to the feat that any 1st-level character gets and the bonus feat granted to a ~human~[TAG_HUMANS] character. The fighter gains an additional bonus feat at 2nd level and every two fighter levels thereafter (4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th, and 20th). A fighter must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including ~ability score~[TAG_ABILITY_SCORES] and ~base attack bonus~[TAG_LEVEL_BONUSES] minimums. These bonus feats are in addition to the feat that a character of any class gets every three levels.List of Fighter Bonus Feats[CMD_CHILDREN_SORTED]

TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MONK_ABUNDANT_STEP	TAG_MONKS			Abundant Step	At 12th level or higher, a monk can slip magically between spaces, as if using the spell ~Dimension Door~[TAG_SPELLS_DIMENSION_DOOR], once per day.  A monk can only use this ability, if she is equipped with a ~Monk's Belt~[TAG_MONK'S_BELT].
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MONK_AC_BONUS	TAG_MONKS			AC Bonus	A monk is highly trained at dodging blows, and she has a sixth sense that lets her avoid even unanticipated attacks.     When unarmored and unencumbered, the monk adds her ~Wisdom~[TAG_WISDOM] bonus (if any) to her ~AC~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS].  In addition, a monk gains a +1 bonus to AC at 5th level.  This bonus increases by 1 for every 5 levels thereafter (+2 at 10th, +3 at 15th, and +4 at 20th level).     These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when the monk is ~flat-footed~[TAG_FLAT_FOOTED].  She loses these bonuses when she is immobilized or ~helpless~[TAG_HELPLESS], when she wears any armor, when she carries a shield, or when she carries a medium or heavy load.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MONK_BONUS_FEAT	TAG_MONKS			Bonus Feats	     1st level:    gains ~Stunning Fist~[TAG_STUNNING_FIST]     2nd level: may select either ~Combat Reflexes~[TAG_COMBAT_REFLEXES] or ~Deflect Arrows~[TAG_DEFLECT_ARROWS]     6th level:  gains ~Improved Trip~[TAG_IMPROVED_TRIP]     A monk need not have any of the prerequisites normally required for these feats to select them.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MONK_DIAMOND_BODY	TAG_MONKS			Diamond Body	At 11th level, a monk gains immunity to ~poisons~[TAG_POISON] of all kinds.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MONK_DIAMOND_SOUL	TAG_MONKS			Diamond Soul	At 13th level, a monk gains ~spell resistance~[TAG_SPECIAL_ABILITIES_SPELL_RESISTANCE] equal to her current monk level + 10.  In order to affect the monk with a spell, a spellcaster must get a result on a caster level check (1d20 + ~caster level~[TAG_CASTER_LEVEL]) that equals or exceeds the monk's spell resistance.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MONK_EMPTY_BODY	TAG_MONKS			Empty Body	At 19th level, a monk gains the ability to assume an ethereal state for 1 round per monk level per day.  She may go ethereal on a number of different occasions during any single day, as long as the total number of rounds spent in an ethereal state does not exceed her monk level.Note: In ToEE, the Empty Body ability has not been implemented.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MONK_EVASION	TAG_MONKS			Evasion	A monk of 2nd level and higher can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility.  If she makes a successful ~Reflex~[TAG_REFLEX] ~saving throw~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC] against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save (such as a ~Fireball~[TAG_SPELLS_FIREBALL]), she instead takes no damage.  Evasion can be used only if a monk is wearing light armor or no armor.  A ~helpless~[TAG_HELPLESS] monk (such as the one who is ~unconscious~[TAG_UNCONSCIOUS] or ~paralyzed~[TAG_PARALYZED]) does not gain the benefit of evasion.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MONK_FAST_MOVEMENT	TAG_MONKS			Fast Movement	At 3rd level and higher, a monk gains an ~enhancement~[TAG_ENHANCEMENT_BONUS] bonus to her speed.  A monk in armor (even light armor) or carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed.Level   @tSpeed3rd     @t+10 ft.6th     @t+20 ft.9th     @t+30 ft.12th    @t+40 ft.15th    @t+50 ft.18th    @t+60 ft.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MONK_FLURRY_OF_BLOWS	TAG_MONKS			Flurry of Blows	When unarmored, a monk may strike with a flurry of blows at the expense of accuracy.  When doing so, she may make one extra attack in a round at her highest ~base attack bonus~[TAG_LEVEL_BONUSES], but this attack takes a -2 penalty, as does each other attack made that round.  This penalty applies for 1 round, so it also affect ~attacks of opportunity~[TAG_AOO] the monk might make before her next action.     When a monk reaches 5th level, the penalty lessens to -1, and at 9th level it disappears entirely.  A monk must use a ~full attack~[TAG_FULL_ATTACK] action to strike with a flurry of blows.     When using flurry of blows, a monk may attack only with ~unarmed strikes~[TAG_WEAPONS_STRIKE_UNARMED] or with special monk weapons (~broom~[TAG_WEAPONS_BROOM], ~butterfly sword~[TAG_WEAPONS_SWORD_BUTTERFLY], ~dao~[TAG_WEAPONS_DAO], ~kama~[TAG_WEAPONS_KAMA], ~quarterstaff~[TAG_WEAPONS_QUARTERSTAFF], ~rake~[TAG_WEAPONS_RAKE], ~sai~[TAG_WEAPONS_SAI], ~shuriken~[TAG_WEAPONS_SHURIKEN], ~siangham~[TAG_WEAPONS_SIANGHAM], ~tonfa~[TAG_WEAPONS_TONFA], and ~war fan~[TAG_WEAPONS_WAR_FAN]).  She may attack with unarmed strikes and special monk weapons interchangeably as desired.     For example, at 6th level, the monk Ember could make one attack with her unarmed strike at an attack bonus of +3 and one attack with a special monk weapon at an attack bonus of +3.     When using weapons as a part of a flurry of blows, a monk applies her ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH] bonus to her damage rolls for all successful attacks, whether she wields a weapon in one or both hands.  The monk can't use any weapon other than a special monk weapon as part of a flurry of blows.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MONK_IMPROVED_EVASION	TAG_MONKS			Improved Evasion	At 9th level, a monk's evasion ability improves.  She still takes no damage on a successful ~Reflex~[TAG_REFLEX] ~saving throw~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC] against attacks such as a ~Fireball~[TAG_SPELLS_FIREBALL], but henceforth she takes only half damage on a failed save.  A ~helpless~[TAG_HELPLESS] monk (such as one who is ~unconscious~[TAG_UNCONSCIOUS] or ~paralyzed~[TAG_PARALYZED]) does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MONK_KI_STRIKE	TAG_MONKS			Ki Strike	At 4th level, a monk's unarmed attacks are empowered with ki.  Her unarmed attacks are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with ~damage reduction~[TAG_SPECIAL_ABILITIES_DAMAGE_REDUCTION].  Ki strike improves with the character's monk level.     At 10th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction.  At 16th level, her unarmed attacks are treated as ~adamantine~[TAG_ADAMANTINE] weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction and bypassing hardness.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MONK_PERFECT_SELF	TAG_MONKS			Perfect Self	At 20th level, a monk becomes a magical creature.  She is forevermore treated as an outsider rather than as a humanoid (or whatever the monk's creature type was) for the purpose of spells and magical effects.  Additionally, the monk gains ~damage reduction~[TAG_SPECIAL_ABILITIES_DAMAGE_REDUCTION] 10/magic, which allows her to ignore the first 10 points of damage from any attack made by a nonmagical weapon or by any natural attack made by a creature that doesn't have similar damage reduction.  Unlike other outsiders, the monk can still be brought back from the dead as if she were a member of her previous creature type.Note: In ToEE, the Perfect Self ability has not been implemented.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MONK_PURITY_OF_BODY	TAG_MONKS			Purity of Body	At 5th level, a monk gains control over her body's immune system.  She gains immunity to all ~diseases~[TAG_DISEASED] except for supernatural and magical diseases.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MONK_QUIVERING_PALM	TAG_MONKS			Quivering Palm	Starting at 15th level, a monk can set up vibrations within the body of another creature that can thereafter be fatal if the monk so desires.  She can use this quivering palm attack once a week, and she must announce her intent before making her ~attack roll~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL].  Constructs, oozes, plants, undead, incorporeal creatures, and creatures immune to ~critical hits~[TAG_CRITICAL_HIT] cannot be affected.  Otherwise, if the monk strikes successfully and the target takes damage from the blow, the quivering palm attack succeeds.  Thereafter the monk can try to slay the victim at any later time, as long as the attempt is made within a number of days equal to her monk level.  To make such an attempt, the monk merely wills the target to die (a ~free action~[TAG_FREE_ACTION]), and unless the target makes a ~Fortitude~[TAG_FORTITUDE] ~saving throw~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC] (DC 10 + 1/2 the monk's level + the monk's ~Wis~[TAG_WISDOM] modifier), it dies.  If the saving throw is successful, the target is no longer in danger from that particular quivering palm attack, but it may still be affected by another one at a later time.Note: In ToEE, the Quivering Palm ability has not been implemented.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MONK_SLOW_FALL	TAG_DUMMY			Slow Fall	At 4th level and higher, a monk within arm's reach of a wall can use it to slow her descent.  When first using this ability, she takes damage as if the fall were 20 feet shorter than it actually is.  The monk's ability to slow her fall (that is, reduce the effective distance of the fall when next to a wall) improves with her monk level.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MONK_STILL_MIND	TAG_MONKS			Still Mind	A monk of 3rd level and higher gains a +2 bonus on ~saving throws~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC] against spells and effects from the ~Enchantment~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_ENCHANTMENT] school, since her meditation and training improve her resistance to mind-affecting attacks.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_STILL_MIND	TAG_DUMMY			Still Mind	A monk of 3rd level and higher gains a +2 bonus on ~saving throws~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC] against spells and effects from the ~Enchantment~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_ENCHANTMENT] school, since her meditation and training improve her resistance to mind-affecting attacks.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MONK_UNARMED_STRIKE	TAG_MONKS			Unarmed Strike	Monks are highly trained in fighting unarmed, giving them considerable advantages when doing so.  At 1st level, a monk gains ~Improved Unarmed Strike~[TAG_IMPROVED_UNARMED] as a bonus feat.  A monk's attacks may be with either fist interchangeably or even from elbows, knees, and feet.  This means that a monk may even make unarmed strikes with her hands full.  There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed.  A monk may thus apply her full ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH] bonus on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes.     Usually a monk's unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose to deal ~nonlethal damage~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_NONLETHAL_DAMAGE] instead with no penalty on her ~attack roll~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL].     A monk's unarmed strike is treated both as a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purposes of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons (such as the ~Magic Fang~[TAG_SPELLS_MAGIC_FANG] and ~Magic Weapon~[TAG_SPELLS_MAGIC_WEAPON] spells).                                     Unarmed Damage TableLevel     ~small~[TAG_SIZE_MODIFIER] monk              ~medium~[TAG_SIZE_MODIFIER] monk                  ~large~[TAG_SIZE_MODIFIER] monk1                @t1d4                               @t1d6                              @t1d82                @t1d4                               @t1d6                              @t1d83                @t1d4                               @t1d6                              @t1d84                @t1d6                               @t1d8                              @t2d65                @t1d6                               @t1d8                              @t2d66                @t1d6                               @t1d8                              @t2d67                @t1d6                               @t1d8                              @t2d68                @t1d8                               @t1d10                            @t2d89                @t1d8                               @t1d10                            @t2d810               @t1d8                               @t1d10                            @t2d811               @t1d8                               @t1d10                            @t2d812               @t1d10                             @t2d6                            @t3d613               @t1d10                             @t2d6                              @t3d614               @t1d10                             @t2d6                            @t3d615               @t1d10                             @t2d6                              @t3d616               @t2d6                             @t2d8                              @t3d817               @t2d6                             @t2d8                              @t3d818               @t2d6                             @t2d8                              @t3d819               @t2d6                             @t2d8                              @t3d820             @t2d8                             @t2d10                          @t4d8

TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_PALADIN_AURA_OF_COURAGE	TAG_PALADINS			Aura of Courage	Beginning at 3rd level, a paladin is immune to ~fear~[TAG_FEAR] (magical or otherwise).  Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a +4 morale bonus on ~saving throws~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC] against fear effects.  This ability functions while the paladin is conscious, but not if she is ~unconscious~[TAG_UNCONSCIOUS] or ~dead~[TAG_DEAD].
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_PALADIN_AURA_OF_GOOD	TAG_PALADINS			Aura of Good	The power of a paladin's aura of good (see the ~Detect Good~[TAG_SPELLS_DETECT_GOOD] spell) is equal to her paladin level, just like the aura of a ~cleric~[TAG_CLERICS] of a good ~deity~[TAG_RELIGION].
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_PALADIN_DETECT_EVIL	TAG_PALADINS			Detect Evil	At will, a paladin can use the spell ~Detect Evil~[TAG_SPELLS_DETECT_EVIL].
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_PALADIN_DIVINE_GRACE	TAG_PALADINS			Divine Grace	At 2nd level, a paladin gains a bonus equal to her ~Charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA] bonus (if any) on all ~saving throws~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC].
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_PALADIN_DIVINE_HEALTH	TAG_PALADINS			Divine Health	At 3rd level, a paladin gains immunity to all ~diseases~[TAG_DISEASED], including supernatural and magical diseases.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_PALADIN_LAY_ON_HANDS	TAG_PALADINS			Lay on Hands	Beginning at 2nd level, a paladin with a ~Charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA] score of 12 or higher can heal wounds (her own or those of others) by touch.  Each day she can heal a total number of ~hit points~[TAG_HIT_POINTS] of damage equal to:                 the paladin's level x the paladin's Charisma bonus     For example, a 7th-level paladin with a 16 Charisma (+3 bonus) can heal 21 points of damage per day.  A paladin may choose to divide her healing among multiple recipients, and she doesn't have to use it all at once.  Using lay on hands is a ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION].     Alternatively, a paladin can use any or all of this healing power to deal damage to undead creatures.  Using lay on hands in this way requires a successful melee touch attack and doesn't provide an ~attack of opportunity~[TAG_AOO].  The paladin decides how many of her daily allotment of points to use as damage after successfully touching an undead creature.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_PALADIN_REMOVE_DISEASE	TAG_PALADINS			Remove Disease	At 6th level, a paladin can produce a ~Remove Disease~[TAG_SPELLS_REMOVE_DISEASE] effect, as the spell, once per week.  She can use this ability one additional time per week for every three levels after 6th (twice per week at 9th, three times at 12th, and so forth).
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_PALADIN_SMITE_EVIL	TAG_PALADINS			Smite Evil	Once per day a paladin may attempt to smite evil with one normal ~melee attack~[TAG_MELEE_ATTACKS].  She adds her ~Charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA] bonus (if any) to her ~attack roll~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL] and deals 1 extra point of damage per paladin level.  If the paladin accidentally smites a creature that is not evil, the smite has no effect, but the ability is still used up for that day.     At 5th level, and at every five levels thereafter, the paladin may smite evil one additional time per day to a maximum of five times per day at 20th level.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_PALADIN_TURN_UNDEAD	TAG_PALADINS			Turn Undead	When a paladin reaches 4th level, she gains the supernatural ability to ~turn undead~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_CLERIC_TURN_REBUKE_UNDEAD].  She may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her ~Charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA] modifier.  She turns undead as a ~cleric~[TAG_CLERICS] of three levels lower would.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_PALADIN_WEAPON_ARMOR_PROF	TAG_PALADINS			Weapon and Armor Proficiency	Paladins are proficient with all ~simple~[TAG_SIMPLE_WEAPONS] and ~martial~[TAG_MARTIAL_WEAPONS] weapons, with all types of armor (~heavy~[TAG_ARMOR_HEAVY], ~medium~[TAG_ARMOR_MEDIUM], and ~light~[TAG_ARMOR_LIGHT]) and with ~shields~[TAG_ARMOR_SHIELD].
TAG_EX_PALADIN	TAG_PALADINS			Ex-Paladins	A paladin who ceases to be ~Lawful Good~[TAG_LAWFUL_GOOD], who willfully commits an evil act, or who grossly violates the code of conduct loses all paladin spells and abilities.  She may not progress any farther in levels as a paladin.     She regains her abilities and advancement potential if she ~atones~[TAG_SPELLS_ATONEMENT] for her violations.  High ranking ~clerics~[TAG_CLERICS] of good gods can help fallen paladins atone for their past deeds.

A ranger may select from the alternative lists of animal companions just as a druid can, though again his effective druid level is half his ranger level.Animal Companion ListLevels 4-7+:~Attack Dog~[TAG_MONSTER_ATTACK_DOG]~Chicken~[TAG_MONSTER_CHICKEN]~Dire Rat~[TAG_MONSTER_DIRE_RAT]~Jackal~[TAG_MONSTER_JACKAL]~Wolf~[TAG_MONSTER_WOLF]Levels 8-13+:~Black Bear~[TAG_MONSTER_BLACK_BEAR]~Giant Lizard~[TAG_MONSTER_GIANT_LIZARD]~Panda Bear~[TAG_MONSTER_PANDA_BEAR]Levels 14-19+:~Brown Bear~[TAG_MONSTER_BROWN_BEAR]Level 20:~Polar Bear~[TAG_MONSTER_POLAR_BEAR]
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_RANGER_COMBAT_STYLE	TAG_RANGERS			Combat Style	At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: Archery or Two-Weapon Combat     If the ranger selects Archery, he is treated as having the ~Rapid Shot~[TAG_RAPID_SHOT] feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.     If the ranger selects Two-Weapon Combat, he is treated as having the ~Two-Weapon Fighting~[TAG_TWO_FIGHTING] feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.     The benefits of the ranger's chosen style apply only when he wears light or no armor.  He loses all benefits of his combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_RANGER_EVASION	TAG_RANGERS			Evasion 	At 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility.  If he makes a successful ~Reflex~[TAG_REFLEX] ~saving throw~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC] against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save (such as a ~Fireball~[TAG_SPELLS_FIREBALL]), he instead takes no damage.  Evasion can be used only if a ranger is wearing light armor or no armor.  A ~helpless~[TAG_HELPLESS] ranger (such as one who is ~unconscious~[TAG_UNCONSCIOUS] or ~paralyzed~[TAG_PARALYZED]) does not gain the benefit of evasion.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_RANGER_FAVORED_ENEMY	TAG_RANGERS			Favored Enemy	At 1st level, a ranger selects a type of creature to act as his favorite enemy.  Due to his extensive study of his chosen type of foe and training in the proper techniques for combating such creatures, the ranger gains a +2 bonus on ~Bluff~[TAG_BLUFF], ~Listen~[TAG_LISTEN], ~Sense Motive~[TAG_SENSE_MOTIVE], ~Spot~[TAG_SPOT], and ~Survival~[TAG_SURVIVAL] checks when using these ~skills~[TAG_SKILLS] against creatures of this type.  Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls against such creatures.     At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy.  In addition, at each interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by 2.  For example, a 5th-level ranger has two favored enemies; against one he gains a +4 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks and weapon damage rolls, and against the other he has a +2 bonus.  At 10th level, he has three favored enemies, and he gains an additional +2 bonus, which he can allocate to the bonus against any one of his three favored enemies.  Thus, his bonuses could be either +4, +4, +2, or +6, +2, +2.     If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy (for instance, devils are both evil outsiders and lawful outsiders), the ranger's bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.Note: At Levels 15 and 20, you may have to select a previously chosen Favored Enemy, as a new Favored Enemy, if you want your ranger to receive the +2 bonus against that creature type.Ranger Favored Enemy typesAberrationAnimalBeastConstructDragonElementalFeyGiantMagical BeastMonstrous HumanoidOozePlantShapechangerUndeadVerminEvil OutsiderGood OutsiderLawful OutsiderChaotic OutsiderGoblinoidReptilianDwarfElfGnollGnomeHalflingOrcHuman
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_RANGER_IMPROVED_COMBAT_STYLE	TAG_RANGERS			Improved Combat Style	At 6th level, a ranger's aptitude in a chosen combat style (Archery or Two-Weapon Combat) improves.     If he selected Archery at 2nd level, he is treated as having the ~Manyshot~[TAG_MANYSHOT] feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.     If the ranger selected Two-Weapon Combat at 2nd level, he is treated as having the ~Improved Two-Weapon Fighting~[TAG_IMPROVED_TWO_WEAPON_FIGHTING] feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.     As before, the benefits of the ranger's combat style apply only when he wears light or no armor.  He loses all benefits of his combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_RANGER_SWIFT_TRACKER	TAG_RANGERS			Swift Tracker	Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while following tracks without taking the normal -5 penalty.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_RANGER_TRACK	TAG_RANGERS			Track	A ranger gains ~Track~[TAG_TRACK] as a bonus feat.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_RANGER_WEAPON_ARMOR_PROF	TAG_RANGERS			Weapon and Armor Proficiency	A ranger is proficient with all ~simple~[TAG_SIMPLE_WEAPONS] and ~martial~[TAG_MARTIAL_WEAPONS] weapons, and with ~light~[TAG_ARMOR_LIGHT] armor and ~shields~[TAG_ARMOR_SHIELD].

TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_CRIPPLING_STRIKE	TAG_ROGUES			Crippling Strike	On attaining 10th, 13th, 16th, and 19th levels, a rogue gains a special ability of her choice from among Crippling Strike, ~Defensive Roll~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_DEFENSIVE_ROLL], ~Improved Evasion~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_IMPROVED_EVASION], ~Opportunist~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_OPPORTUNIST], and ~Slippery Mind~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_SLIPPERY_MIND].  The following describes Crippling Strike.     A rogue with this ability can ~sneak attack~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_SNEAK_ATTACK] opponents with such precision that her blows weaken and hamper them.  An opponent damaged by one of her sneak attacks also takes 2 points of ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH] damage.  Ability points lost to damage return on their own at the rate of 1 point per day for each damaged ability.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_DEFENSIVE_ROLL	TAG_ROGUES			Defensive Roll	On attaining 10th, 13th, 16th, and 19th levels, a rogue gains a special ability of her choice from among ~Crippling Strike~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_CRIPPLING_STRIKE], Defensive Roll, ~Improved Evasion~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_IMPROVED_EVASION], ~Opportunist~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_OPPORTUNIST], and ~Slippery Mind~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_SLIPPERY_MIND].  The following describes Defensive Roll.     The rogue can roll with a potentially lethal blow to take less damage from it than she otherwise would.  Once per day, when she would be reduced to 0 or fewer ~hit points~[TAG_HIT_POINTS] by damage in combat (from a weapon or other blow, not a spell or special ability), the rogue can attempt to roll with the damage.  To use this ability, the rogue must attempt a ~Reflex~[TAG_REFLEX] ~saving throw~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC]:                                               DC = damage dealt     If the save succeeds, she takes only half damage from the blow; if it fails, she takes full damage.  She must be aware of the attack and able to react to it in order to execute her defensive roll--if she is denied her ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] bonus to ~AC~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS], she can't use this ability.  Since this effect would not normally allow a character to make a Reflex save for half damage, the rogue's ~evasion~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_EVASION] ability does not apply to the defensive roll.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_EVASION	TAG_ROGUES			Evasion	A rogue of 2nd level and higher can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility.  If she makes a successful ~Reflex~[TAG_REFLEX] ~saving throw~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC] against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save (such as a ~Fireball~[TAG_SPELLS_FIREBALL]), she instead takes no damage.  Evasion can be used only if a rogue is wearing light armor or no armor.  A ~helpless~[TAG_HELPLESS] rogue (such as one who is ~unconscious~[TAG_UNCONSCIOUS] or ~paralyzed~[TAG_PARALYZED]) does not gain the benefit of evasion.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_IMPROVED_EVASION	TAG_ROGUES			Improved Evasion	On attaining 10th, 13th, 16th, and 19th levels, a rogue gains a special ability of her choice from among ~Crippling Strike~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_CRIPPLING_STRIKE], ~Defensive Roll~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_DEFENSIVE_ROLL], Improved Evasion, ~Opportunist~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_OPPORTUNIST], and ~Slippery Mind~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_SLIPPERY_MIND].  The following describes Improved Evasion.     This ability works like ~evasion~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_EVASION], except that while the rogue still takes no damage on a successful ~Reflex~[TAG_REFLEX] ~saving throw~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC] against attacks such as a dragon's breath weapon or a ~Fireball~[TAG_SPELLS_FIREBALL], henceforth she takes only half damage on a failed save.  A ~helpless~[TAG_HELPLESS] rogue (such as one who is ~unconscious~[TAG_UNCONSCIOUS] or ~paralyzed~[TAG_PARALYZED]) does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_IMPROVED_UNCANNY_DODGE	TAG_ROGUES			Improved Uncanny Dodge	A rogue of 8th level or higher can no longer be ~flanked~[TAG_FLANKING]; she can react to opponents on opposite sides of her as easily as she can react to a single attacker. This defense denies another rogue the ability to ~sneak attack~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_SNEAK_ATTACK] the rogue by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.     If a character already has ~uncanny dodge~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARBARIAN_UNCANNY_DODGE] from a second class, the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead, and the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_OPPORTUNIST	TAG_ROGUES			Opportunist	On attaining 10th, 13th, 16th, and 19th levels, a rogue gains a special ability of her choice from among ~Crippling Strike~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_CRIPPLING_STRIKE], ~Defensive Roll~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_DEFENSIVE_ROLL], ~Improved Evasion~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_IMPROVED_EVASION], Opportunist, and ~Slippery Mind~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_SLIPPERY_MIND].  The following describes Opportunist.     Once per round, the rogue can make an ~attack of opportunity~[TAG_AOO] against an opponent who has just been struck for damage in melee by another character.  This attack counts as the rogue's attack of opportunity for that round.  Even a rogue with the ~Combat Reflexes~[TAG_COMBAT_REFLEXES] feat can't use the opportunist ability more than once per round.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_SKILL_MASTERY	TAG_ROGUES			Skill Mastery	On attaining 10th level, a rogue gains the special ability of Skill Mastery.  The following describes Skill Mastery.     The rogue becomes so certain in the use of certain ~skills~[TAG_SKILLS] that she can use them reliably even under adverse conditions.  Upon gaining this ability, she selects a number of skills equal to 3 + her ~Intelligence~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE] modifier.  When making a ~skill check~[TAG_USING_SKILLS] with one of these skills, she gains a +2 bonus.  This bonus stacks with ~Skill Focus~[TAG_SKILL_FOCUS].Note: In ToEE, the Skill Mastery ability has not been implemented.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_SLIPPERY_MIND	TAG_ROGUES			Slippery Mind	On attaining 10th, 13th, 16th, and 19th levels, a rogue gains a special ability of her choice from among ~Crippling Strike~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_CRIPPLING_STRIKE], ~Defensive Roll~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_DEFENSIVE_ROLL], ~Improved Evasion~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_IMPROVED_EVASION], ~Opportunist~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_OPPORTUNIST], and Slippery Mind.  The following describes Slippery Mind.     This ability represents the rogue's ability to wriggle free from magical effects that would otherwise control or compel her.  If a rogue with slippery mind is affected by an ~Enchantment~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_ENCHANTMENT] spell or effect and fails her ~saving throw~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC], she can attempt it again 1 round later at the same DC.  She gets only this one extra chance to succeed on her saving throw.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_SNEAK_ATTACK	TAG_ROGUES			Sneak Attack	If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage.  Basically, the rogue's attack deals extra damage any time her target would be denied a ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] bonus to ~AC~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS] (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue ~flanks~[TAG_FLANKING] her target.  This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and it increases by 1d6 every two rogue levels thereafter.  Should the rogue score a ~critical hit~[TAG_CRITICAL_HIT] with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied.     ~Ranged attacks~[TAG_RANGED_ATTACKS] can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.  A rogue can't strike with deadly accuracy from beyond that range.  With a ~sap~[TAG_WEAPONS_SAP] (blackjack) or an ~unarmed strike~[TAG_WEAPONS_STRIKE_UNARMED], a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals ~nonlethal damage~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_NONLETHAL_DAMAGE] instead of lethal damage.  She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual -4 penalty, because she must make optimal use of her weapon in order to execute a sneak attack.     A rogue can sneak attack only living creatures with discernible anatomies--undead, constructs, oozes, plants, and incorporeal creatures lack vital areas to attack.  Any creature that is immune to critical hits is not vulnerable to sneak attacks.  The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot.  A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with ~concealment~[TAG_CONCEALMENT] or striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are beyond reach.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_TRAPS	TAG_ROGUES			Traps	Trapfinding: Rogues (and only rogues) can use the ~Search~[TAG_SEARCH] skill to locate traps when the task has a Difficulty Class higher than 20.  Finding a nonmagical trap has a DC of at least 20, or higher if it is well hidden.  Finding a magic trap has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it.     Rogues (and only rogues) can use the ~Disable Device~[TAG_DISABLE_DEVICE] skill to disarm magic traps.  A magic trap generally has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it.     A rogue who beats a trap's DC by 10 or more with a Disable Device check can study a trap, figure out how it works, and bypass it (with her party) without disarming it.Trap Sense: At 3rd level, a rogue gains an intuitive sense that alerts her to danger from traps, giving her a +1 bonus on ~Reflex~[TAG_REFLEX] saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to ~AC~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS] against attacks made by traps.  These bonuses rise to +2 when the rogue reaches 6th level, to +3 when she reaches 9th level, to +4 when she reaches 12th level, to +5 at 15th, and to +6 at 18th level.  Trap bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_UNCANNY_DODGE	TAG_ROGUES			Uncanny Dodge	Starting at 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so.  She retains her ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] bonus to ~AC~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS] (if any) even if she is caught ~flat-footed~[TAG_FLAT_FOOTED] or struck by an ~invisible~[TAG_INVISIBLE] attacker.  However, she still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.

TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ANIMAL_COMPANION	TAG_DUMMY			Animal Companion	A druid may begin play with an animal companion that must be selected from the druid ~Animal Companions~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_DRUID_ANIMAL_COMPANION].  At 4th level, a ranger gains an animal companion that must be selected from the ranger ~Animal Companions~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_RANGER_ANIMAL_COMPANION].
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_CALL_FAMILIAR	TAG_DUMMY			Call Familiar	A sorcerer can call a ~familiar~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_SORCERER_CALL_FAMILIAR].  A wizard can also call a ~familiar~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_WIZARD_CALL_FAMILIAR].
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_EVASION	TAG_DUMMY			Evasion	A monk or rogue of 2nd level and higher or a ranger of 9th level and higher can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility.  If he makes a successful ~Reflex~[TAG_REFLEX] ~saving throw~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC] against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save (such as a ~Fireball~[TAG_SPELLS_FIREBALL]), he instead takes no damage.  Evasion can be used only if a monk, rogue, or ranger is wearing light armor or no armor.  A ~helpless~[TAG_HELPLESS] monk, rogue, or ranger (such as one who is ~unconscious~[TAG_UNCONSCIOUS] or ~paralyzed~[TAG_PARALYZED]) does not gain the benefit of evasion.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_FAST_MOVEMENT	TAG_DUMMY			Fast Movement	A barbarian's land speed is ~faster~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARBARIAN_FAST_MOVEMENT] than the norm for his race by +10 feet.  This benefit applies only when he is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor, and not carrying a heavy load.  Apply this bonus before modifying the barbarian's speed because of any load carried or armor worn.At 3rd level and higher, a monk gains an enhancement ~bonus~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MONK_FAST_MOVEMENT] to her speed.  A monk in armor (even light armor) or carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_IMPROVED_EVASION	TAG_DUMMY			Improved Evasion	At 9th level, a monk's evasion ability improves.  On attaining 10th, 13th, 16th, and 19th levels, a rogue may gain (your choice) the special ability of improved evasion.  This ability works like ~evasion~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_EVASION], except that while the monk or rogue still takes no damage on a successful ~Reflex~[TAG_REFLEX] ~saving throw~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC] against attacks such as a ~Fireball~[TAG_SPELLS_FIREBALL], but henceforth she takes only half damage on a failed save.  A ~helpless~[TAG_HELPLESS] monk or rogue (such as one who is ~unconscious~[TAG_UNCONSCIOUS] or ~paralyzed~[TAG_PARALYZED]) does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_IMPROVED_UNCANNY_DODGE	TAG_DUMMY			Improved Uncanny Dodge	A barbarian of 5th level or higher or a rogue of 8th level or higher can no longer be ~flanked~[TAG_FLANKING]; he can react to opponents on opposite sides of him as easily as he can react to a single attacker.  This defense denies a ~rogue~[TAG_ROGUES] the ability to ~sneak attack~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_SNEAK_ATTACK] the barbarian or rogue by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has barbarian or rogue levels.     If a character already has ~uncanny dodge~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_UNCANNY_DODGE] from a second class, the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead, and the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.
TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_UNCANNY_DODGE	TAG_DUMMY			Uncanny Dodge	A barbarian at 2nd level or a rogue at 4th level gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so.  He retains his ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] bonus to ~AC~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS] (if any) even if he is caught ~flat-footed~[TAG_FLAT_FOOTED] or struck by an ~invisible~[TAG_INVISIBLE] attacker.  However, he still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.
TAG_SKILLS				Skills	A character's skills represent a variety of abilities. As a character advances in level, he or she gets better at using some or all of her skills.[CMD_CHILDREN]
TAG_ACQUIRE_SKILLS	TAG_SKILLS			Acquiring Skill Ranks	Characters begin with a certain number of skill points to assign to various skills. Depending on the class, this is 2, 4, 6, or 8 + the ~Intelligence~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE] modifier, and then multiplied by 4. ~Humans~[TAG_HUMANS] gain an extra 4 skill points.              ~Clerics~[TAG_CLERICS], ~Fighters~[TAG_FIGHTERS], ~Paladins~[TAG_PALADINS], ~Sorcerers~[TAG_SORCERERS], and ~Wizards~[TAG_WIZARDS]                                        (2 + Int modifier) x 4                                ~Barbarians~[TAG_BARBARIANS], ~Druids~[TAG_DRUIDS], and ~Monks~[TAG_MONKS]                                        (4 + Int modifier) x 4                                           ~Bards~[TAG_BARDS] and ~Rangers~[TAG_RANGERS]                                        (6 + Int modifier) x 4                                                      ~Rogues~[TAG_ROGUES]                                        (8 + Int modifier) x 4After first level, skill points are assigned at the same rates above, but without the x 4 multiplier. Thus a 2nd level bard gains 6 + Int modifier new skill points. Humans gain one extra skill point each level as well.To spend skill points to buy skill ranks, one skill point can be spent for each class skill. If a character wants to buy a non-class skill rank, he or she must spend 2 skill points to gain one rank, or one skill point to gain a half rank.A character may never buy more than their level + 3 skill ranks in any one class skill. So a 4th level rogue cannot buy skill ranks above level 7 for class skills. For non-class skills, this maximum number is halved. So the same level 4 rogue could not buy ranks above 3.5 in any non-class skill.
TAG_USING_SKILLS	TAG_SKILLS			Using Skills	Skills are used by performing skill checks.To make a skill check, roll:                                        1d20 + skill modifier(skill modifier = skill rank + ability modifier + miscellaneous modifiers)Each skill has a key ability associated with it, which affects the ability modifier above. Miscellaneous modifiers include racial bonuses, armor check penalties, and bonuses provided by feats, among others.Some checks are made against a DC (difficulty class). This number is assigned according to the situation, and then the skill check is made against it. If the skill check roll matches or exceeds the DC, the skill has been performed successfully.Usually a character can try again on a fail, although time may pass. If failure would result in danger, then trying again may not be possible.Characters may perform untrained skill checks against their key ability modifiers.
TAG_SKILL_DES	TAG_SKILLS			Skill Descriptions	[CMD_CHILDREN_SORTED]
TAG_APPRAISE	TAG_SKILL_DES			Appraise	Use this skill to tell an antique from junk, an old, fancy sword from an elven heirloom, and high-quality jewelry from cheap imitations. In the game, the displayed values for items that appear in the bartering interfaces will be modified depending upon your level of expertise (or rank) in Appraise.  Therefore, you will be able to purchase items for less money, and in turn sell items for more profit, if you have a higher Appraise skill. The key ability for Appraise is ~Intelligence~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE].
TAG_BLUFF 	TAG_SKILL_DES			Bluff	You can make the outrageous or the untrue seem plausible. The skill encompasses acting, conning, fast talking, misdirection, and misleading body language.  A ~Sense Motive~[TAG_SENSE_MOTIVE] check allows an NPC to determine if you are bluffing.  Bluff can also be used to ~feint~[TAG_FEINT] an opponent in combat. In the game, the success or failure of an attempted Bluff is determined by your skill level.  Within the dialogue, some lines will have a DC that your skill level must equal or exceed in order to be successful.  In the event that your skill level does beat the DC, a line of dialogue will appear with an icon, acknowledging your superior ability in that skill.  Selecting the line will draw you into an appropriate course of conversation for your actions. The key ability for Bluff is ~Charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA].
TAG_CONCENTRATION	TAG_SKILL_DES			Concentration	You are particularly good at focusing your mind. As a spellcaster, you must make a Concentration check whenever you take damage while casting a spell, to determine whether or not the spell is disrupted.  A spellcaster may be vulnerable to damage while casting a spell or while readying an action through ~attacks of opportunity~[TAG_AOO].  The higher your skill level in Concentration, the more likely that you will be successful in casting a spell, even under duress. The key ability for Concentration is ~Constitution~[TAG_CONSTITUTION].
TAG_DIPLOMACY	TAG_SKILL_DES			Diplomacy	Diplomacy is a skill that can be used when speaking with NPCs. It encompasses etiquette, social grace, tact, and a way with words. This skill represents the ability to give others the right impression of yourself. Like other dialogue skills, your true success regarding Diplomacy in the game is dependent upon your skill level.  Within the dialogue, some lines will have a DC that your skill level must equal or exceed in order to be successful.  In the event that your skill level does beat the DC, a line of dialogue will appear with an icon, acknowledging your superior ability in that skill.  Selecting the line will draw you into an appropriate course of conversation for your actions. The key ability for Diplomacy is ~Charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA].
TAG_DISABLE_DEVICE	TAG_SKILL_DES			Disable Device	Use this skill to attempt to disarm a trap on a chest or door. The Disable Device skill check determines if your skill level is higher or lower than the DC of the trap that you are trying to disable.  If this skill check succeeds, the trap is deactivated.  A character must be aware of a trap in order to disable it. If the Disable Device skill check fails by 4 or more, the trap will be triggered.  Otherwise, the skill check may be used indefinitely. ~Rogues~[TAG_ROGUES] (and other characters with the trapfinding class feature) can disarm magical traps against a DC of 25 + the spell level of the magic used to create it. The key ability for Disable Device is ~Intelligence~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE], though it can only be used if one has been trained in it.
TAG_GATHER_INFORMATION	TAG_SKILL_DES			Gather Information	Gather Information is the key ability used to garner rumors, find out local gossip, and collect general knowledge from others throughout the game. It can be used in conversations with NPCs to open up new avenues of dialogue. In ToEE, the quality of information and rumors that you obtain from others is directly related to your skill level in Gather Information.  The higher your skill level, the juicier the rumor or the more interesting and helpful the information will be.  Regardless of skill level, you will be asked to pay a standard fee for any information you accumulate. The game has several different story-states, and in each story there are different levels of success in gathering information.  If you return to a story in which you have previously had little success, after bumping up your skill level you might find the situation to be much improved.  There are many avenues of dialogue that Gather Information can open for your character. The key ability for Gather Information is ~Charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA].
TAG_HEAL	TAG_SKILL_DES			Heal	Use this skill to keep a badly wounded friend from dying. Heal can only be used on a ~dying~[TAG_DYING] creature.  If a character has negative ~hit points~[TAG_HIT_POINTS] and is losing hit points (at the rate of 1 per round, 1 per hour, or 1 per day), you can make him or her stable.  A character can be healed if the Heal check succeeds against a DC of 15.  A stable character is unable to regain hit points but will no longer lose any hit points. The key ability for Heal is ~Wisdom~[TAG_WISDOM].
TAG_HIDE	TAG_SKILL_DES			Hide	Use this skill to sink back into the shadows and proceed unseen. A hostile character may not detect you if you have hidden well.  As a player, you can use Hide (and ~Move Silently~[TAG_MOVE_SILENTLY] as well) for being in "~sneak~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_SNEAK]" mode.  A successful attempt at using Hide is opposed by the ~Spot~[TAG_SPOT] check of anyone who might be able to see you. The key ability for Hide is ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY].  Armor check penalties apply.
TAG_INTIMIDATE	TAG_SKILL_DES			Intimidate	Intimidate is another skill that can be used to open up new avenues of dialog with NPCs, although they may not warm to you in the same manner. You may use this skill to get a bully to back down, to frighten an opponent, or to get information by forceful means. In the game, some lines of dialogue will have a DC that your skill level must equal or exceed in order to be successful.  In the event that your skill level does beat the DC, a line of dialogue will appear with an icon, acknowledging your superior ability in that skill.  Selecting the line will draw you into an appropriate course of conversation for your actions. The key ability for Intimidate is ~Charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA].
TAG_LISTEN	TAG_SKILL_DES			Listen	Use a Listen check to try to hear enemies approaching or to listen through a door to an adjacent room. It can alert you to the presence of enemies, taking away ~surprise rounds~[TAG_SURPRISE] (for example, the enemy could surprise you, but you make the Listen check and manage to avoid a surprise round) and possibly even give you a surprise round (in turn, you are able to surprise the enemy).  Listen is used as the opposing check for ~Move Silently~[TAG_MOVE_SILENTLY], enabling you to hear a person while they are in "~sneak~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_SNEAK]" mode (which Move Silently is a part of). The key ability for Listen is ~Wisdom~[TAG_WISDOM].
TAG_MOVE_SILENTLY	TAG_SKILL_DES			Move Silently	As with ~Hide~[TAG_HIDE], you use this skill to remain undetected by an enemy while moving. If you are unsuccessful at making your skill check against an opposing ~Listen~[TAG_LISTEN] check, you will be heard and the enemy will see you.  Move Silently is used as part of being in "~sneak~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_SNEAK]" mode, and its skill bonuses apply only when sneaking. The key ability for Move Silently is ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY].  Armor check penalties apply.
TAG_OPEN_LOCK	TAG_SKILL_DES			Open Lock	You can pick all kinds of locks with this skill. Your skills in using Open Lock are pitted against the DC of the lock (or the lock's difficulty).  If successful, the lock is picked (and will never again be locked).  This skill check can be used indefinitely. Its key ability is ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY], though it can only be used if one has been trained in it.
TAG_PERFORM	TAG_SKILL_DES			Perform	Perform is used solely for the purpose of increasing one's ~bardic music~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_BARDIC_MUSIC] abilities. This skill is not recommended for use by any class other than the ~bard~[TAG_BARDS]. Its key ability is ~Charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA].
TAG_SEARCH	TAG_SKILL_DES			Search	You can find secret doors and simple traps by searching. Search does not allow a character to find complex traps unless she is a ~rogue~[TAG_ROGUES].  Search lets characters discern some small details or irregularities through active effort, while ~Spot~[TAG_SPOT] lets the character notice something, such as a hiding rogue. A concentrated Search skill check is available via the ~radial menu~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU], using the Hammer & Anvil icon. This skill allows a player to search for traps.  This skill check will result in an automatic 20 ("take 20"), including help from any party members who can successfully complete a skill check of DC 10 (rolled automatically in the game).  Those party members who were successful in making the Search check would help through gaining a +2 bonus.  Only rogues can find magical traps (DC 20+). There is also a passive search conducted when "using" any container or portal that contains an unnoticed trap.  This passive search will stop the "use" if it successfully finds a trap.  If unsuccessful, the trap will go off. This skill check can be retried indefinitely. Its key ability is ~Intelligence~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE].
TAG_SENSE_MOTIVE	TAG_SKILL_DES			Sense Motive	Sense Motive is a dialogue skill that enables your character tell if an NPC is lying to your party. It is generally performed against the NPC's ~Bluff~[TAG_BLUFF] skill. Within the dialogue, some lines will have a DC that your Sense Motive skill level must equal or exceed in order to be successful.  In the event that your skill level does beat the DC, a line of dialogue will appear with an icon, acknowledging your superior ability in that skill.  For Sense Motive, if the line even appears at all, you automatically recognize that the NPC is lying.  If you choose to select that line and begin a dialogue exchange, this selection means that you call the NPC on his or her bluff attempt. Its key ability is ~Wisdom~[TAG_WISDOM].
TAG_SLEIGHT	TAG_SKILL_DES			Sleight of Hand	You can palm a tiny or small object. This skill is used for the basic purposes of pick pocketing.  When you use this skill under close observation, your skill check is opposed by the observer's ~Spot~[TAG_SPOT] check.  The observer's success doesn't prevent you from performing the action, just from doing it unnoticed. If you try to take something from another creature, you must make a DC 20 Sleight of Hand check to obtain it.  The opponent makes a Spot check to detect the attempt, opposed by the same Sleight of Hand check result you achieved when you tried to grab the item. Its key ability is ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY], though it can only be used if trained.  Armor check penalties also apply.
TAG_SPELLCRAFT	TAG_SKILL_DES			Spellcraft	This skill enables a spellcaster to recognize a spell cast by an enemy spellcaster. It is used by ~wizards~[TAG_WIZARDS] to copy a scroll into their ~spellbook~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_WIZARD_SPELLBOOK].  Spellcraft will also allow you to automatically ~counterspell~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_READY_COUNTERSPELL] a specific spell that is known. Its key ability is ~Intelligence~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE], and it can only be used if trained.
TAG_SPOT	TAG_SKILL_DES			Spot	Use this skill to spot unnoticed creatures. Spot is used solely as an opposing check against ~Hide~[TAG_HIDE] and is rolled automatically within the game to determine success or failure. Its key ability is ~Wisdom~[TAG_WISDOM].
TAG_SURVIVAL	TAG_SKILL_DES			Survival	You are able to avoid ~random encounters~[TAG_HMU_RANDOM_ENCOUNTER_UI] while traveling on the ~World Map~[TAG_HMU_WORLDMAP_UI], if your Survival skill is high enough. You will have the choice of whether to avoid them or go ahead with them depending on what you detect with your skill.  For example, if the player's skill rank equals or exceeds the CR (challenge rating), they are shown an interface which presents the creatures involved in the random encounter.  The player is given the choice to enter the encounter or skip it entirely.  If the skill rank is less then the CR of the encounter, the player is not shown the interface and the encounter begins. Its key ability is ~Wisdom~[TAG_WISDOM].
TAG_TUMBLE	TAG_SKILL_DES			Tumble	You can use this skill to move through an enemy square or to move to avoid an ~attack of opportunity~[TAG_AOO]. The Tumble skill check will automatically be rolled when:  - movement draws an attack of opportunity  - the moving player has at least one point in Tumble  - the mover is not wearing medium or heavy armor If the Tumble check succeeds, no attack of opportunity is allowed. Its key ability is ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] and it can only be used if trained.
TAG_UMD	TAG_SKILL_DES			Use Magic Device	Use this skill to activate a magic device, including scrolls and wands, that you could not otherwise activate. A Use Magic Device check is automatically rolled when attempting to use such magic items, if the normal prerequisites for using the item are not met. Its key ability is ~Charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA] and it can only be used if trained.
TAG_FEATS				Feats	A feat is a special feature that either gives your character a new capability or improves one that he or she already has. Unlike skills, feats have no ranks. A character either has a feat or he does not.[CMD_CHILDREN]~Item Creation Feats~[TAG_ITEM_CREATION]~Metamagic Feats~[TAG_METAMAGIC]
TAG_ACQUIRE_FEATS	TAG_FEATS			Acquiring Feats	Each character gets one feat upon creation. At 3rd level and every three levels thereafter (6th, 9th, and such), he or she gains another feat. Additionally, ~fighters~[TAG_FIGHTERS] and ~wizards~[TAG_WIZARDS] get bonus class-related feats chosen from special lists. A ~human~[TAG_HUMANS] character also gets a bonus feat at 1st level, chosen by the player. Some feats have prerequisites as noted.

You also gain a +4 bonus on your ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH] check to trip your opponent.     If you trip an opponent in melee combat, you immediately get a ~melee attack~[TAG_MELEE_ATTACKS] against that opponent as if you hadn't used your attack for the trip attempt.     Normal: Without this feat, you provoke an attack of opportunity when you attempt to trip an opponent.     Special: At 6th level, a ~monk~[TAG_MONKS] gains Improved Trip as a bonus feat, even if she does not have the prerequisites.     A ~fighter~[TAG_FIGHTERS] may select Improved Trip as one of his fighter bonus feats.

Examples of a ~martial weapon~[TAG_MARTIAL_WEAPONS].     Benefit: You make ~attack rolls~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL] with the selected weapon normally.     Normal: When using a weapon with which you are not proficient, you take a -4 penalty on attack rolls.     Special: You can gain Martial Weapon Proficiency multiple times.  Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of weapon.     ~Barbarians~[TAG_BARBARIANS], ~fighters~[TAG_FIGHTERS], ~paladins~[TAG_PALADINS], and ~rangers~[TAG_RANGERS] are proficient with all martial weapons.

A condition that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) also makes you lose dodge bonuses.  Dodge bonuses (such as this one and a ~dwarf's~[TAG_DWARVES] racial bonus on dodge attempts against giants) stack with each other, unlike most types of bonuses.     Special: A ~fighter~[TAG_FIGHTERS] may select Mobility as one of his fighter bonus feats.

A quickened spell uses up a spell slot four levels higher than the spell's actual level.     Special: This feat can't be applied to any spell cast spontaneously (including ~sorcerer~[TAG_SORCERERS] spells and ~bard~[TAG_BARDS] spells), since applying a metamagic feat to a spontaneously cast spell automatically increases the casting time to a full-round action.
TAG_RAPID_RELOAD	TAG_FEATS_DES		TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_FIGHTER_BONUS_FEATS	Rapid Reload	     You can reload a ~light~[TAG_WEAPONS_CROSSBOW_LIGHT] or ~heavy~[TAG_WEAPONS_CROSSBOW_HEAVY] crossbow more quickly than normal.     Prerequisite: Weapon Proficiency (Light or Heavy Crossbow)     Benefit: The time required for you to ~reload~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_RELOAD] your chosen type of crossbow is reduced to a ~free action~[TAG_FREE_ACTION] (for a light crossbow) or a ~move action~[TAG_MOVEMENT_ACTION] (for a heavy crossbow). Reloading a crossbow still provokes an ~attack of opportunity~[TAG_AOO].     If you have selected this feat for a light crossbow, you may fire that weapon as many times in a ~full attack~[TAG_FULL_ATTACK] action as if you could attack if you were using a bow.     Normal: A character without this feat needs a move action to reload a light crossbow, or a ~full-round action~[TAG_FULL_ROUND_ACTION] to reload a heavy crossbow.     Special: A ~fighter~[TAG_FIGHTERS] may select Rapid Reload as one of her fighter bonus feats.

In addition to the costs derived from the base price, you must expend the material component or pay the XP when scribing the scroll.
TAG_SELF_SUFFICIENT	TAG_FEATS_DES			Self-Sufficient	You can take care of yourself in harsh environments and situations.     Benefit: You get a +2 bonus on all ~Heal~[TAG_HEAL] and ~Survival~[TAG_SURVIVAL] checks.

TAG_SILENT_SPELL	TAG_FEATS_DES		TAG_METAMAGIC	Silent Spell	You can cast spells silently.     Benefit: A silent spell can be cast with no verbal components.

Thrown weapons, such as spears, are immediately thrown back at the original attacker (even though it isn't your turn).     You must have at least one hand free (holding nothing) to use this feat.     Special: A ~fighter~[TAG_FIGHTERS] may select Snatch Arrows as one of his fighter bonus feats.
TAG_SPELL_FOCUS	TAG_FEATS_DES			Spell Focus	Choose a ~school~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS] of magic, such as ~Illusion~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_ILLUSION].  Your spells of that school are more potent than normal.     Benefit: Add +1 to the Difficulty Class for all ~saving throws~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC] against spells from the school of magic you select.     Special: You can gain this feat multiple times.  Its effects do not stack.  Each time you take the feat, it apples to a new school of magic.
TAG_SPELL_PENETRATION	TAG_FEATS_DES			Spell Penetration	Your spells are especially potent, breaking through ~spell resistance~[TAG_SPECIAL_ABILITIES_SPELL_RESISTANCE] more readily than normal.     Benefit: You get a +2 bonus on ~caster level~[TAG_CASTER_LEVEL] checks (1d20 + caster level) made to overcome a creature's spell resistance.
TAG_SPRING_ATTACK	TAG_FEATS_DES		TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_FIGHTER_BONUS_FEATS	Spring Attack	You are trained in fast ~melee attacks~[TAG_MELEE_ATTACKS] and fancy footwork.     Prerequisites: ~Dex~[TAG_DEXTERITY] 13, ~Dodge~[TAG_DODGE], ~Mobility~[TAG_MOBILITY], ~base attack bonus~[TAG_LEVEL_BONUSES] +4     Benefit: When using the attack action with a melee weapon, you can move both before and after the attack, provided that your total distance moved is not greater than your speed.  Moving in this way does not provoke an ~attack of opportunity~[TAG_AOO] from the defender you attack, though it might provoke attacks of opportunity from other creatures, if appropriate.  You can't use this feat if you are wearing heavy armor.     You must move at least 5 feet both before and after you make your attack in order to utilize the benefits of Spring Attack.     Special: A ~fighter~[TAG_FIGHTERS] may select Spring Attack as one of his fighter bonus feats.Note: In the ~Options~[TAG_HMU_OPTIONS_UI] menu, under the Preferences tab, the "End Turn after Default Action" option must be deactivated, to allow your characters to use Spring Attack.
TAG_STEALTHY	TAG_FEATS_DES			Stealthy	You are particularly good at avoiding notice.     Benefit: You get a +2 bonus on all ~Hide~[TAG_HIDE] and ~Move Silently~[TAG_MOVE_SILENTLY] checks.
TAG_STILL_SPELL	TAG_FEATS_DES		TAG_METAMAGIC	Still Spell	You can cast spells without gestures.     Benefit: A stilled spell can be cast with no somatic components.  Spells without somatic components are not affected.  A stilled spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.
TAG_STUNNING_FIST	TAG_FEATS_DES		TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_FIGHTER_BONUS_FEATS	Stunning Fist	You know how to strike opponents in vulnerable areas.     Prerequisite: ~Dex~[TAG_DEXTERITY] 13, ~Wis~[TAG_WISDOM] 13, ~Improved Unarmed Strike~[TAG_IMPROVED_UNARMED], ~base attack bonus~[TAG_LEVEL_BONUSES] +8     Benefit: You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your ~attack roll~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL] (thus, a failed attack roll ruins the attempt).  Stunning Fist forces a foe damaged by ~unarmed attack~[TAG_WEAPONS_STRIKE_UNARMED] to make a ~Fortitude~[TAG_FORTITUDE] ~saving throw~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC] (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier), in addition to dealing damage normally.  A defender who fails this saving throw is ~stunned~[TAG_STUNNED] for 1 round (until just before your next action).  A stunned character can't act, loses any Dexterity bonus to ~AC~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS], and takes a -2 penalty to AC.  You may attempt a stunning attack once per day for every four levels you have attained, and no more than once per round.  Constructs, oozes, plants, undead, incorporeal creatures, and creatures immune to ~critical hits~[TAG_CRITICAL_HIT] cannot be stunned.     Special: A ~monk~[TAG_MONKS] gains Stunning Fist as a bonus feat at 1st level, even if she does not meet the prerequisites.  A monk may attempt a stunning attack once per monk level per day.     A ~fighter~[TAG_FIGHTERS] may select Stunning Fist as one of her fighter bonus feats.
TAG_TOUGHNESS	TAG_FEATS_DES			Toughness	You are tougher than normal.     Benefit: You gain +3 ~hit points~[TAG_HIT_POINTS].     Special: A character may gain this feat multiple times.  Its effects stack.
TAG_TRACK	TAG_FEATS_DES			Track	You can identify different types of creatures (e.g. ~elementals~[TAG_MONSTER_ELEMENTAL]) and the general direction in which they are traveling.     Benefit:  Your ability to find tracks or follow them is dependent upon your rank, or the number of ~skill points~[TAG_ACQUIRE_SKILLS] you have, in ~Survival~[TAG_SURVIVAL]. If your rank in Survival is greater than or equal to the creature's CR, you are able to see the direction and the creature type.  Tracks of repeated creature types are not visible to you; for example, if there are two sets of human tracks, you see only one of them.  The most creature or monster types you can identify is 5.     Normal: Without this feat, you will not be able to tell the general direction of a creature's path nor will you be able to identify its type.     Special: You can only gain this feat once.     A ~ranger~[TAG_RANGERS] automatically has Track as a bonus feat.
TAG_TWO_WEAPON_DEFENSE	TAG_FEATS_DES		TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_FIGHTER_BONUS_FEATS	Two-Weapon Defense	Your two-weapon fighting style bolsters your defense as well as your offense.     Prerequisite: ~Dex~[TAG_DEXTERITY] 15, ~Two-Weapon Fighting~[TAG_TWO_FIGHTING]     Benefit: When wielding two weapons (not including natural weapons or ~unarmed strikes~[TAG_WEAPONS_STRIKE_UNARMED]), you gain a +1 ~shield~[TAG_SHIELD_BONUS] bonus to your ~AC~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS].     When you are ~fighting defensively~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_FIGHT_DEFENSIVELY] or using the ~total defense~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_TOTAL_DEFENSE] action, this shield bonus increases to +2.     Special: A ~fighter~[TAG_FIGHTERS] may select Two-Weapon Defense as one of his fighter bonus feats.
TAG_TWO_FIGHTING	TAG_FEATS_DES		TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_FIGHTER_BONUS_FEATS	Two-Weapon Fighting	You can fight with a weapon in each hand.  You can make one extra attack each round with the second weapon.     Prerequisite: ~Dex~[TAG_DEXTERITY] 15     Benefit: Your penalties on ~attack rolls~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL] for fighting with two weapons are reduced.  The penalty for your primary hand lessens by 2 and the one for your off hand lessens by 6.     Normal: See information about ~Attacking with Two Weapons~[TAG_TWO_WEAPONS].     Special: A ~fighter~[TAG_FIGHTERS] may select Two-Weapon Fighting as one of his fighter bonus feats.     A 2nd-level ~ranger~[TAG_RANGERS] who has chosen the ~Two-Weapon Combat Style~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_RANGER_COMBAT_STYLE] is treated as having Two-Weapon Fighting, even if he does not have the prerequisites for it, but only when he is wearing light or no armor.
TAG_WEAPON_FINESSE	TAG_FEATS_DES		TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_FIGHTER_BONUS_FEATS	Weapon Finesse	You are especially skilled at using weapons that can benefit as much from ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] as from ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH].     Prerequisite: ~base attack bonus~[TAG_LEVEL_BONUSES] +1     Benefit: With a light weapon or ~rapier~[TAG_WEAPONS_RAPIER] made for a creature of your ~size~[TAG_SIZE_MODIFIER] category, you may use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on ~attack rolls~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL].  If you carry a ~shield~[TAG_ARMOR_SHIELD], its armor check penalty applies to your attack rolls.     Special: A ~fighter~[TAG_FIGHTERS] may select Weapon Finesse as one of her fighter bonus feats.
TAG_WEAPON_FOCUS	TAG_FEATS_DES		TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_FIGHTER_BONUS_FEATS	Weapon Focus	Choose one type of weapon, such as ~greataxe~[TAG_WEAPONS_GREATAXE].  You can also choose ~unarmed strike~[TAG_WEAPONS_STRIKE_UNARMED] or ray (if you are a spellcaster) as your weapon for the purpose of this feat.  You are especially good at using this weapon.  (If you have chosen ray, you are especially good with rays, such as the one produced by the ~Ray of Frost~[TAG_SPELLS_RAY_OF_FROST] spell.)     Prerequisite: Proficiency with selected weapon, ~base attack bonus~[TAG_LEVEL_BONUSES] +1     Benefit: You gain a +1 bonus on all ~attack rolls~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL] you make using the selected weapon.     Special: You can gain this feat multiple times.  Its effects do not stack.  Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of weapon.     A ~fighter~[TAG_FIGHTERS] may select Weapon Focus as one of his fighter bonus feats.  He must have Weapon Focus with a weapon to gain the ~Weapon Specialization~[TAG_WEAPON_SPEC] feat for that weapon.
TAG_WEAPON_SPEC	TAG_FEATS_DES		TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_FIGHTER_BONUS_FEATS	Weapon Specialization	Choose one type of weapon, such as a ~greataxe~[TAG_WEAPONS_GREATAXE], for which you have already selected the ~Weapon Focus~[TAG_WEAPON_FOCUS] feat.  You can also choose ~unarmed strike~[TAG_WEAPONS_STRIKE_UNARMED] or ray (if you are also a spellcaster) as your weapon for the purpose of this feat.  You deal extra damage when using this weapon.     Prerequisites: Proficiency with selected weapon, Weapon Focus with selected weapon, ~Fighter~[TAG_FIGHTERS] level 4th     Benefit: You gain a +2 bonus on all damage rolls you make using the selected weapon.     Special: You can gain this feat multiple times.  Its effects do not stack.  Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of weapon.     A fighter may select Weapon Specialization as one of his fighter bonus feats.
TAG_WHIRLWIND_ATTACK	TAG_FEATS_DES		TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_FIGHTER_BONUS_FEATS	Whirlwind Attack	You can strike nearby opponents in an amazing spinning attack.     Prerequisites: ~Dex~[TAG_DEXTERITY] 13, ~Int~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE] 13, ~Combat Expertise~[TAG_COMBAT_EXPERTISE], ~Dodge~[TAG_DODGE], ~Mobility~[TAG_MOBILITY], ~Spring Attack~[TAG_SPRING_ATTACK], ~base attack bonus~[TAG_LEVEL_BONUSES] +4     Benefit: When you use the ~full attack~[TAG_FULL_ATTACK] action, you can give up your regular attacks and instead make one ~melee attack~[TAG_MELEE_ATTACKS] at your full base attack bonus against each opponent within reach.     When you use the Whirlwind Attack feat, you also forfeit any bonus or extra attacks granted by other feats or abilities (such as the ~Cleave~[TAG_CLEAVE] feat or the ~Haste~[TAG_SPELLS_HASTE] spell).     Special: A ~fighter~[TAG_FIGHTERS] may select Whirlwind Attack as one of his fighter bonus feats.
TAG_WIDEN_SPELL	TAG_FEATS_DES		TAG_METAMAGIC	Widen Spell	You can increase the area of your spells.     Benefit: You can alter a burst, emanation, line, or spread-shaped spell to increase its area.  Any numeric measurements of the spell's area increase by 100%.  For example, a widened ~Fireball~[TAG_SPELLS_FIREBALL] spell (which normally produces a 20-ft. radius spread) now fills a 40-ft. radius spread.  Spells that do not have an area of one of these four sorts are not affected by this feat.  A widened spell uses up a spell slot three levels higher than the spell's actual level.
TAG_MAGIC				Magic	Casting Spells: Your spellcaster will be able to cast spells through the use of the ~radial menu~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU] in the game.  By selecting the class and level of the spell, the spellcaster's available spells will be shown and available for casting.     Casting in ~combat~[TAG_COMBAT] usually requires a ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION], although some require a ~full-round action~[TAG_FULL_ROUND_ACTION].  In ToEE, a full-round spell occurs instantaneously and then the caster gets no further action.     ~Sorcerers~[TAG_SORCERERS] or ~bards~[TAG_BARDS] who are casting a ~metamagic~[TAG_METAMAGIC] version of a spell must take more time to do so.  If a spell's normal casting time is 1 standard action, then casting a metamagic version of the spell is a full-round action for a sorcerer or bard.     While casting in combat usually is a standard action, the occasional spell may require a casting time referred to as ~Out of Combat~[TAG_OUT_OF_COMBAT].     Sometimes distractions (often through combat) require a spellcaster to make a ~Concentration~[TAG_CONCENTRATION] check to see if the spell is successful.  Spell failure results in the loss of that spell.The majority of spells belong to one of eight ~schools~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS] of magic.Spells belong to one of two types:~Arcane Spells~[TAG_ARCANE_SPELLS]~Divine Spells~[TAG_DIVINE_SPELLS]Some magical creatures can create magical effects without being spellcasters, and certain ~magic items~[TAG_MAGIC_ITEMS] create magical effects.  These effects come in two types: spell-like and supernaturalAdditionally, members of certain ~classes~[TAG_CLASSES] and certain creatures can use special abilities that aren't magical.  These abilities are called: extraordinary or natural
TAG_ARCANE_SPELLS	TAG_MAGIC			Arcane Spells	~Wizards~[TAG_WIZARDS], ~sorcerers~[TAG_SORCERERS], and ~bards~[TAG_BARDS] can cast arcane spells, which involve the direct manipulation of mystic energies.  These manipulations require natural talent (in the case of sorcerers), long study (in the case of wizards), or both (in the case of bards).  Compared to ~divine spells~[TAG_DIVINE_SPELLS], arcane spells are more likely to produce dramatic results, such as flight, explosions, or transformations.     ~Intelligence~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE] is the key attribute for wizard spells, while ~Charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA] is the key attribute for sorcerers and bards.     Wizards must rest each day to regain spells.  Spells must be prepared each day from their available list, filling each slot with a spell.  Spells intended to be used more than once must take a slot for each intended casting.     Sorcerers and bards also rest to regain spells.  However, they do not need to fill slots with particular spells.  They can cast any spell from their spell list, as long as they still have enough spell slots to cast.     Arcane spells may be subject to ~failure~[TAG_ARCANE_SPELL_FAILURE] if the caster is wearing ~armor~[TAG_ARMOR].
TAG_DIVINE_SPELLS	TAG_MAGIC			Divine Spells	~Clerics~[TAG_CLERICS], ~druids~[TAG_DRUIDS], experienced ~paladins~[TAG_PALADINS], and experienced ~rangers~[TAG_RANGERS] can cast divine spells.  Unlike ~arcane spells~[TAG_ARCANE_SPELLS], divine spells draw power from a divine source.  Clerics gain spell power from ~deities~[TAG_RELIGION] or from divine forces.  The divine forces of nature power druids' and rangers' spells.  The divine powers of law and good power paladins' spells.  Divine spells tend to focus on healing and protection and are less flashy, destructive, and disruptive than arcane spells.     ~Wisdom~[TAG_WISDOM] is the key attribute for casting divine spells and controls the highest level of spells the character may have.     A divine caster is required to rest to regain spells.  They must prepare which spells they wish to cast for the next day by filling in available slots.  Clerics channeling positive energy can substitute a Cure spell for any spell in their list, while negative channeling clerics can substitute Inflict spells.  This is called ~spontaneous casting~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_CLERIC_SPONTANEOUS_CASTING].  Druids can substitute a Summon Nature's Ally spell for any spell in their list, also called ~spontaneous casting~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_DRUID_SPONTANEOUS_CASTING].
TAG_CASTER_LEVEL	TAG_MAGIC			Caster Level	A spell's power often depends on its caster level, which for most spellcasting characters is equal to your class level in the class you're using to cast the spell.     You can cast a spell at a lower caster level than normal, but the caster level you choose must be high enough for you to cast the spell in question, and all level-dependent features must be based on the same caster level.     In the event that a ~class feature~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_DESC], ~domain~[TAG_DOMAINS] granted power, or other special ability provides an adjustment to your caster level, that adjustment applies not only to effects based on caster level (such as range, duration, and damage dealt) but also to your caster level check to overcome your target's ~spell resistance~[TAG_SPECIAL_ABILITIES_SPELL_RESISTANCE] and to the caster level used in dispel checks (both the dispel check and the DC of the check).
TAG_ARCANE_SPELL_FAILURE	TAG_ARCANE_SPELLS			Arcane Spell Failure	~Armor~[TAG_ARMOR] interferes with the gestures that a spellcaster must make to cast an ~arcane spell~[TAG_ARCANE_SPELLS] that has a somatic component.  Arcane spellcasters face the possibility of arcane spell failure if they're wearing armor, so ~wizards~[TAG_WIZARDS] and ~sorcerers~[TAG_SORCERERS] usually don't do so.  ~Bards~[TAG_BARDS] can wear light armor without incurring any arcane spell failure chance for their bard spells.
TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS	TAG_MAGIC			Magic Schools	The magic schools are:~Abjuration~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_ABJURATION]~Conjuration~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_CONJURATION]~Divination~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_DIVINATION]~Enchantment~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_ENCHANTMENT]~Evocation~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_EVOCATION]~Illusion~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_ILLUSION]~Necromancy~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_NECROMANCY]~Transmutation~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_TRANSMUTATION]
TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_ABJURATION	TAG_MAGIC			Abjuration	Abjurations are protective spells.  They create physical or magical barriers, negate magical or physical abilities, harm trespassers, or even banish the subject of the spell to another plane of existence.  Representative spells include  ~Protection from Evil~[TAG_SPELLS_PROTECTION_FROM_EVIL] and ~Dispel Magic~[TAG_SPELLS_DISPEL_MAGIC].     If an abjuration creates a barrier that keeps certain types of creatures at bay, that barrier cannot be used to push away those creatures.
TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_CONJURATION	TAG_MAGIC			Conjuration	Each conjuration spell belongs to one of five subschools.Calling: Can transport creatures from another plane of existence to your plane.  The spell grants the creature the one-time ability to return to its plane of origin.  Creatures who are called actually die when they are killed; they don't just disappear and reform.  The duration of a calling spell is instantaneous.Creation: Can create objects or effects on the spot.  If the spell's duration is not instantaneous, magic will hold the creation together, and when the spell ends, the conjured creature or object vanishes without a trace.  If the spell's duration is instantaneous, the created object or creature is merely assembled through magic, and will last indefinitely, as it does not depend on magic for its existence.Healing: Certain divine conjurations heal creatures or even bring them back to life.  These include Cure spells (for example, ~Cure Minor Wounds~[TAG_SPELLS_CURE_MINOR_WOUNDS]), which good ~clerics~[TAG_CLERICS] can ~cast spontaneously~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_CLERIC_SPONTANEOUS_CASTING].Teleportation: Can transport one or more creatures or objects a great distance.  The most powerful of these spells can cross planar boundaries.  Teleportation is one-way and not dispellable.  It is instantaneous travel through the Astral Plane; therefore, anything that blocks astral travel also blocks teleportation.Summoning: Can bring manifestations of objects, creatures, or some form of energy to you.  When the spell ends or is dispelled, a summoned creature is instantly sent back, but only if the spell description indicates this.  A summoned creature also goes away if it is killed or if its ~hit points~[TAG_HIT_POINTS] drop to 0 or lower, but it is not really dead.  It will reform in 24 hours and can't be summoned again during this time.
TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_DIVINATION	TAG_MAGIC			Divination	Divination spells enable you to learn secrets long forgotten, to predict the future, to find hidden things, and to foil deceptive spells.  Representative spells include ~Identify~[TAG_SPELLS_IDENTIFY], ~Clairaudience/Clairvoyance~[TAG_SPELLS_CLAIRAUDIENCE_CLAIRVOYANCE], and ~True Seeing~[TAG_SPELLS_TRUE_SEEING].Scrying: A scrying spell effect is an invisible magical sensor that sends you information.  Unless noted otherwise, the sensor has the same powers of any sensory acuity that you possess.  This level of acuity includes any spells or effects that target you (such as ~See Invisibility~[TAG_SPELLS_SEE_INVISIBILITY]), but not spells that emanate from you (such as ~Detect Evil~[TAG_SPELLS_DETECT_EVIL]).  However, the sensor functions as an independent organ, so it will continue to work even if you are ~blinded~[TAG_BLINDED], ~deafened~[TAG_DEAFENED], etc.
TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_ENCHANTMENT	TAG_MAGIC			Enchantment	Enchantment spells affect the minds of others, influencing or controlling their behavior.  Representative spells include ~Charm Person~[TAG_SPELLS_CHARM_PERSON].  All enchantments are mind-affecting spells.  Two types of enchantment spells grant you influence over a subject creature.Charm: A charm spell changes how the subject views you, typically in a positive manner, ensuring that they see you as a good friend.Compulsion: A compulsion spell forces the subject to act in some manner or changes the way his mind works.  Some compulsion spells determine the subject's actions or the effects on the subject, some allow you to determine the subject's actions when you cast the spell, and others give you ongoing control over the subject.
TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_EVOCATION	TAG_MAGIC			Evocation	Evocation spells manipulate energy or tap an unseen source of power to produce a desired end.  In effect, they create something out of nothing.  Many of these spells produce spectacular effects, and evocation spells can deal large amounts of damage.  Representative spells include ~Magic Missile~[TAG_SPELLS_MAGIC_MISSILE], ~Fireball~[TAG_SPELLS_FIREBALL], and ~Lightning Bolt~[TAG_SPELLS_LIGHTNING_BOLT].
TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_ILLUSION	TAG_MAGIC			Illusion	Illusion spells deceive the senses or minds of others.  They cause people to see things that are not there, not see things that are there, hear phantom noises, or remember things that never happened.  Representative illusions include ~Invisibility~[TAG_SPELLS_INVISIBILITY].  Illusions come in the following five types:Figments: These spells create a false sensation, one that is the same regardless of who experiences it.  Figments are unable to make something seem to be something else.  For example, a figment spell with audible effects cannot duplicate intelligible speech unless the spell specifically says it can.  Figments cannot produce real effects, and therefore, are useless for directly attacking foes.Glamer: A glamer spell changes a subject's sensory qualities, making it look, feel, taste, smell, or sound like something else, or even seem to disappear.Pattern: This creates an image that others can see and also affects the minds of those who see it or are caught in it.Phantasm: Creates a mental image that usually only the caster and the subjects of the spell can perceive.  This image is totally within the minds of the subjects and is a personalized mental impression.  Third parties don't notice the phantasm.Shadow: Creates something that is partially real.  The caster weaves it from extradimensional energies.  Such illusions can have real effects.  If a creature takes damage from a shadow illusion, that damage is real.Saving Throws and Illusions (Disbelief): Creatures encountering an illusion effect usually do not receive ~saving throws~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC] to recognize it as illusory until they study it carefully or interact with it in some fashion.  A successful saving throw against an illusion reveals it to be false, but a figment or phantasm remains as a translucent outline.  A failed saving throw indicates that a character fails to notice something is amiss.
TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_NECROMANCY	TAG_MAGIC			Necromancy	Necromancy spells manipulate the power of death, unlife, and the life force.  Spells involving undead creatures make up a large part of this school.  Representative spells include ~Cause Fear~[TAG_SPELLS_CAUSE_FEAR] and ~Animate Dead~[TAG_SPELLS_ANIMATE_DEAD].
TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_TRANSMUTATION	TAG_MAGIC			Transmutation	Transmutation spells change the properties of some creature, thing, or condition.  Representative spells include ~Reduce Person~[TAG_SPELLS_REDUCE_PERSON].

TAG_SPELLS_ANIMAL_GROWTH 	TAG_SPELLS		TAG_DRUID_5 TAG_SORCERER_5 TAG_WIZARD_5 TAG_RANGER_4	Animal Growth	~Transmutation~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_TRANSMUTATION]Level: ~Druid~[TAG_DRUIDS] 5, ~Ranger~[TAG_RANGERS] 4, ~Sorcerer~[TAG_SORCERERS]/~Wizard~[TAG_WIZARDS] 5Components: V, SCasting Time: 1 ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION]Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)Targets: Up to one animal (Gargantuan or smaller) per two levels, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apartDuration: 1 min./levelSaving Throw: ~Fortitude~[TAG_FORTITUDE] negatesSpell Resistance: YesA number of animals grow to twice their normal ~size~[TAG_SIZE_MODIFIER] and eight times their normal weight. This alteration changes each animal's size category to the next largest (from Large to Huge, for example), grants it a +8 size bonus to ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH] and a +4 size bonus to ~Constitution~[TAG_CONSTITUTION] (and thus an extra 2 ~hit points~[TAG_HIT_POINTS] per HD), and imposes a -2 size penalty to ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY]. The creature's existing natural armor bonus increases by 2. The size change also affects the animal's modifier to ~AC~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS], ~attack rolls~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL], and its base damage. The animal's reach will change, but the animal's space and speed will not.     The spell also grants each subject ~damage reduction~[TAG_SPECIAL_ABILITIES_DAMAGE_REDUCTION] 10/magic and a +4 resistance bonus on ~saving throws~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC]. All equipment worn or carried by an animal is similarly enlarged by the spell, though this change has no effect on the magical properties of any such equipment. Any enlarged item that leaves the enlarged creature's possession instantly returns to its normal size. The spell gives no means of command or influence over the enlarged animals. Multiple magical effects that increases size do not stack, which means that you can't use a second casting of this spell to further increase the size of an animal that's still under the effect of the first casting.

Only a creature with an Intelligence of 1 or 2 can be ~fascinated~[TAG_FASCINATED] by this spell. You fascinate 2d6 HD worth of creatures. The closest targets are selected first until no more targets within range can be affected. For example, if Vadania affects 7 HD worth of animals and there are several 2 HD ~wolves~[TAG_MONSTER_WOLF] within close range, only the three closest wolves are affected. A magical beast or a ~dire~[TAG_MONSTER_DIRE] animal is allowed a ~saving throw~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC]; other animals are not.

The undead can follow you and it remains animated until it is destroyed. (A destroyed skeleton or zombie can't be animated again.) Material Component: You must place a black onyx gem worth at least 25 gp into the mouth or eye socket of the corpse you intend to animate.

The creature seeking atonement must be truly repentant and desirous of setting right its misdeeds. If the atoning creature committed the evil act unwittingly or under some form of compulsion, atonement operates normally at no cost to you. However, in the case of a creature atoning for deliberate misdeeds and acts of a knowing and willful nature, you must intercede with your deity (requiring you to expend 500 XP) in order to expunge the subject's burden. Atonement may be cast for one purpose. RESTORE CLASS   A paladin who has lost her class features due to committing an evil act may have her paladinhood restored to her by this spell.

It enables you to force extraplanar creatures out of your home plane. As many as 2 Hit Dice of creatures per caster level can be banished. You can improve the spell's chance of success by presenting at least one object or substance that the target hates, fears, or otherwise opposes. For each such object or substance, you gain a +1 bonus on your caster level check to overcome the target's spell resistance (if any), the saving throw DC increases by 2. Certain rare items might work twice as well as a normal item for the purpose of the bonuses (each providing a +2 bonus on the caster level check against spell resistance and increasing the save DC by 4).

You look as though you're winking in and out of reality very quickly and at random. Blinking has several effects, as follows:  - Physical attacks against you have a 50% miss chance, and the ~Blind-Fight~[TAG_BLIND_FIGHT] feat doesn't help opponents, since you're ethereal and not merely ~invisible~[TAG_INVISIBLE]. If the attacker can see invisible creatures, the miss chance is only 20%. Likewise, your own attacks have a 20% miss chance, since you sometimes go ethereal just as you are about to strike.  - Any individually targeted spell has a 50% chance to fail against you while you're blinking unless your attacker can target invisible, ethereal creatures. Your own spells have a 20% chance of activating just as you go ethereal, in which case they typically do not affect the Material Plane. Force effects (such as ~Magic Missile~[TAG_SPELLS_MAGIC_MISSILE]) and ~abjurations~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_ABJURATION] affect you normally.  - While blinking, you take only half damage from area attacks.

Break Enchantment can reverse even an instantaneous effect. For each such effect, you make a ~caster level~[TAG_CASTER_LEVEL] check (1d20 + caster level, maximum of +15) against a DC of 11 + caster level of the effect. Success means that the creature is free of the spell, curse, or effect. For a cursed magic item, the DC is 25. If the spell is one that cannot be dispelled by ~Dispel Magic~[TAG_SPELLS_DISPEL_MAGIC], Break Enchantment works only if that level is 5th level or lower. For instance, ~Bestow Curse~[TAG_SPELLS_BESTOW_CURSE] cannot be dispelled by Dispel Magic, but Break Enchantment can dispel it. If the effect comes from some permanent magic item, such as a cursed sword, Break Enchantment does not remove the curse from the item, but it does free the victim from the item's effects. For example, a cursed item can change the alignment of its user. Break Enchantment allows the victim to be rid of the item and negates the alignment change, but the item's curse is intact and affects the next creature to pick up the item--even if it's the recent recipient of the Break Enchantment spell.

You have no control over the affected creatures, but Calm Emotions can stop raging creatures from fighting or joyous ones from reveling. Creatures so affected cannot take violent actions (although they can defend themselves) or do anything destructive. Any aggressive action against or damage dealt to a calmed creature immediately breaks the spell on all calmed creatures. This spell automatically suppresses (but does not dispel) any morale bonuses granted by spells such as ~Bless~[TAG_SPELLS_BLESS], ~Good Hope~[TAG_SPELLS_GOOD_HOPE], and ~Rage~[TAG_SPELLS_RAGE], as well as negating a bard's ability to ~inspire courage~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_INSPIRE_COURAGE] or a ~barbarian's rage~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARBARIAN_RAGE] ability. It also suppresses any ~fear~[TAG_FEAR] effects and removes the ~confused~[TAG_CONFUSED] condition from all targets. While the spell lasts, a suppressed spell or effect has no effect.

Unattended, nonmagical metal gets no saving throw. Magical metal is allowed a ~saving throw~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC] against the spell. An item in the creature's possession uses the creature's saving throw bonus unless its own is higher. In ToEE, only a creature wearing metal armor is affected by this spell. A creature takes cold damage if its equipment is chilled. It takes full damage if its armor is affected. The creature takes minimum damage (1 point or 2 points) if it's not wearing metal armor. First round of the spell: The metal becomes chilly and uncomfortable to the touch but deals no damage. The same effect also occurs on the last round of the spell's duration. Second (and also the next-to-last) round: Icy coldness causes pain and damage (1d4 points of damage). Third, fourth, and fifth rounds: The metal is freezing cold, causing more damage (2d4 points of damage). Any heat intense enough to damage the creature negates cold damage from the spell (and vice versa) on a point-for-point basis. For example, if the damage roll from a Chill Metal spell indicates 5 points of cold damage and the subject plunges through a fire spell in the same round and takes 10 points of damage, it winds up taking no cold damage and only 5 points of fire damage. Chill Metal counters and dispels ~Heat Metal~[TAG_SPELLS_HEAT_METAL].

You can use Dispel Magic to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magical item, to end ongoing spells (or at least their affects) within an area, or to counter another spellcaster's spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by Dispel Magic. Dispel Magic can dispel (but not counter) the ongoing effects of supernatural abilities as well as spells , and it affects spell-like effects just as it does spells. Note: The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the Dispel Magic can take effect. Thus, you can't use Dispel Magic to repair fire damage caused by a ~Fireball~[TAG_SPELLS_FIREBALL] or to turn a petrified character back to flesh. In these cases, the magic has departed, leaving only burned flesh or perfectly normal stone in it's wake. You choose to use Dispel Magic in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, an area dispel, or a ~counterspell~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_READY_COUNTERSPELL]  Targeted Dispel:  One object, creature, or spell is the target of the Dispel Magic spell. You can make a dispel check (1d20 + your ~caster level~[TAG_CASTER_LEVEL], maximum +10) against the spell or against the each ongoing spell currently in effect on the object or creature. The DC for this dispel check is 11 + the spell's caster level.     If you target an object or creature that is under the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by Monster Summoning), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.     You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.  Area Dispel:  When Dispel Magic is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 30-ft. radius. For each creature within the area that is the subject of one or more spells, you make a dispel check against the last cast spell back to the first cast spell until you dispel one spell (which discharges the Dispel Magic spell so far as that target is concerned). The creature's magic items are not affected.     For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the Dispel Magic spell, you can make a dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.     If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by Monster Summoning) is in the area, you can make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it from whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel spells targeting the creature or object.  Counterspell:  When Dispel Magic is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, Dispel Magic may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.

Items stored in the Extraplanar Chest, and the chest itself, do not count against the load you are carrying and will not overburden you. After you have stored items in the large chest, you must use the miniature chest again to send the large chest back to the Ethereal Plane from whence it came, or it will remain wherever you leave it. Note: Any charged magical items (such as wands, staves, and rods) cannot be recovered from the chest once it has been sent back to the Ethereal Plane and should thus not be stored in it. Additionally, any magic weapons and armor with crafted attributes will lose those attributes if they are stored in the chest and the chest is sent back to the Ethereal Plane, so do not store crafted weapons and armor in the chest. All other items are unaffected. Focus: A chest that must be exceptionally well crafted and expensive, constructed for you by master crafters. The cost of such a chest is 5,000 gp. Once it is constructed, you must make a tiny replica (of the same materials and perfect in every detail), so that the miniature of the chest appears to be a perfect copy. (The replica costs 50 gp.) Note: The casting of this spell costs 5050 gold pieces.

A sickened creature takes a -2 penalty on ~attack rolls~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL], weapon damage rolls, ~saving throws~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC], ~skill checks~[TAG_USING_SKILLS], and ability checks. A creature affected by this spell remains sickened for 10 minutes per ~caster level~[TAG_CASTER_LEVEL]. The effects cannot be negated by a ~Remove Disease~[TAG_SPELLS_REMOVE_DISEASE] or ~Heal~[TAG_SPELLS_HEAL] spell, but a ~Remove Curse~[TAG_SPELLS_REMOVE_CURSE] is effective. Panicked     The subject becomes panicked for 1d4 rounds. Even after the panic ends, the creature remains ~shaken~[TAG_SHAKEN] for 10 minutes per caster level, and it automatically becomes panicked again if it comes within sight of you during that time. This is a ~fear~[TAG_FEAR] effect. Comatose     The subject falls into a catatonic coma for 10 minutes per caster level. During this time, it cannot be awakened by any means short of dispelling the effect. This is not a ~Sleep~[TAG_SPELLS_SLEEP] effect, and thus ~elves~[TAG_ELVES] are not immune to it. The spell lasts for 1 round per three caster levels. You must spend a move action each round after the first to target a foe.     Co8 Note: All the targets must be selected upon casting, and you subsequently sacrifice a move action each round after the first to target each successive foe until all foes have been targeted.

Unattended objects also take this damage. The explosion creates almost no pressure. You point your finger and determine the range (distance and height) at which the Fireball is to burst. A glowing pea-sized bead streaks from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the Fireball at that point.

The spell deals 1d6 points of damage per ~caster level~[TAG_CASTER_LEVEL] (maximum 15d6). Half the damage is fire damage, but the other half results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by resistance to fire-based attacks, such as that granted by ~Protection from Energy~[TAG_SPELLS_PROTECTION_FROM_ENERGY] (fire), ~Fire Shield~[TAG_SPELLS_FIRE_SHIELD] (Chill Shield), and similar magic.

The spell grants a +4 ~enhancement~[TAG_ENHANCEMENT_BONUS] bonus to ~Intelligence~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE], adding the usual benefits to Intelligence-based ~skill checks~[TAG_USING_SKILLS] and other uses of the Intelligence modifier. Wizards (and other spellcasters who rely on Intelligence) affected by this spell do not gain any additional bonus spells for the increased Intelligence, but the save DCs for spells they cast while under this spell's effect do increase. This spell doesn't grant extra ~skill points~[TAG_ACQUIRE_SKILLS].

The subject gains ~damage reduction~[TAG_SPECIAL_ABILITIES_DAMAGE_REDUCTION] 10/magic (i.e., the target can absorb damage up to 10 points, unless it is magic damage) and becomes immune to ~poison~[TAG_POISON] and ~critical hits~[TAG_CRITICAL_HIT]. It can't attack or cast spells with verbal, somatic, or material components while in Gaseous Form. If it has a touch spell ready to use, that spell is discharged harmlessly when the Gaseous Form spell takes effect.

A ~Neutralize Poison~[TAG_SPELLS_NEUTRALIZE_POISON] spell removes the effect from a sickened creature, and creatures immune to ~poison~[TAG_POISON] are unaffected by the stench.

The area of effect of any such spells does not include the area of the Lesser Globe of Invulnerability. Such spells fail to affect any target located within the globe. Excluded efforts include ~spell-like abilities~[TAG_SPECIAL_ABILITIES] and spells or spell-like effects from items. However, any type of spell can be cast through or out of the magical globe. Spells of 4th level and higher are not affected by the globe, nor are spells already in effect when the globe is cast. The globe can be brought down by a targeted ~Dispel Magic~[TAG_SPELLS_DISPEL_MAGIC] spell, but not by an area Dispel Magic. You can leave and return to the globe without penalty. Note: Spell effects are not disrupted unless their effects enter the globe, and even then they are merely suppressed, not dispelled. For example, creatures inside the globe would still see a ~Mirror Image~[TAG_SPELLS_MIRROR_IMAGE] created by a caster outside the globe. If that caster then entered the globe, the images would wink out, only to reappear when the caster exited the globe.

Any creature in the area when the spell is cast must make a successful ~Reflex~[TAG_REFLEX] save or fall. This save is repeated on your turn each round that the creature remains within the area.

A nonintelligent undead creature (such as a skeleton or zombie) gets no ~saving throw~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC]; an intelligent undead creature does. If the spell is successful, it renders the undead creature immobile for the duration of the spell (similar to the effect of ~Hold Person~[TAG_SPELLS_HOLD_PERSON] on a living creature).

This extra speed has several effects. When making a ~full attack~[TAG_FULL_ATTACK] action, a hasted creature may make one extra attack with any weapon it is holding. The attack is made using the creature's full ~base attack bonus~[TAG_LEVEL_BONUSES], plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation. (This effect is not cumulative with similar effects such as that provided by a weapon of speed, nor does it actually grant an extra action, so you can't use it to cast a second spell or otherwise take an extra action in the round.) A hasted creature gains a +1 bonus on ~attack rolls~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL] and a +1 dodge bonus to ~AC~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS] and ~Reflex~[TAG_REFLEX] saves. Any condition that makes you lose your ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes you lose dodge bonuses. All of the hasted creature's movements increase by 30 feet, to a maximum of twice the subject's normal speed.

Unattended, nonmagical metal gets no saving throw. Magical metal is allowed a ~saving throw~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC] against the spell. An item in a creature's possession uses the creature's saving throw bonus unless its own is higher. In ToEE, only a creature wearing metal armor is affected by this spell. A creature takes fire damage if its equipment is heated. It takes full damage if its armor is affected. The creature takes minimum damage (1 point or 2 points) if it's not wearing metal armor. First round of the spell: The metal becomes warm and uncomfortable to touch but deals no damage. The same effect also occurs on the last round of the spell's duration. Second (and also the next-to-last) round: Intense heat causes pain and damage (1d4 points of damage). Third, fourth, and fifth rounds: The metal is searing hot, causing more damage (2d4 points of damage). Any cold intense enough to damage the creature negates fire damage from the spell (and vice versa) on a point-for-point basis. For example, if the damage roll from a Heat Metal spell indicates 2 points of fire damage and the subject is hit by a ~Ray of Frost~[TAG_SPELLS_RAY_OF_FROST] spell in the same round and takes 3 points of cold damage, the subject winds up taking no fire damage and only 1 point of cold damage. Heat Metal counters and dispels ~Chill Metal~[TAG_SPELLS_CHILL_METAL].

All creatures within the area gain the effects of a ~Protection from Evil~[TAG_SPELLS_PROTECTION_FROM_EVIL], and no nongood summoned or conjured creatures can enter the area either. You must overcome a creature's ~spell resistance~[TAG_SPECIAL_ABILITIES_SPELL_RESISTANCE] in order to keep it at bay, but the ~deflection~[TAG_DEFLECTION_BONUS] and resistance bonuses and the protection from mental control apply regardless of enemies' spell resistance. When Magic Circle is cast on a hostile creature, the spell is considered to be focused inward. In this case, the spell binds a nongood called creature and causes the creature to become immobile, provided that you cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the Magic Circle. In the game, casting the spell against a hostile creature results in the circle being considered inward. Likewise, in ToEE, the creature cannot cross the circle's boundaries unless it succeeds at a spell resistance check, at which point it is allowed to move. If the Magic Circle is cast against a friendly creature, the spell/circle is defined as inward.     The creature trapped within the circle can do nothing that directly or indirectly disturbs the circle, but other creatures can. A creature capable of casting ~Dimension Door~[TAG_SPELLS_DIMENSION_DOOR] can simply leave the circle through means of that spell. You can prevent the creature's extradimensional escape by casting a ~Dimension Anchor~[TAG_SPELLS_DIMENSIONAL_ANCHOR] spell on it, but you must act before the creature acts. The creature cannot reach across the magic circle, but its ~ranged attacks~[TAG_RANGED_ATTACKS] (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can. This spell is not cumulative with Protection from Evil and vice versa.

The Negative Energy Protection spell uses positive energy, which can offset the effects of a negative energy attack. Each time the warded creature is struck by a negative energy attack that drains levels or ~ability scores~[TAG_ABILITY_SCORES], it rolls 1d20 + ~caster level~[TAG_CASTER_LEVEL] against a DC of 11 + the attacker's HD. If the warded creature succeeds, the energies cancel. The warded creature takes only ~hit point~[TAG_HIT_POINTS] damage from the attack and does not suffer any drain of experience levels or ability scores, regardless of the number of levels or ability score points the attack would have drained. An attacking undead creature takes 2d6 points of damage from the positive energy.

A ~poisoned~[TAG_POISON] creature suffers no additional effects from the poison, and any temporary effects are ended, but the spell does not reverse instantaneous effects, such as ~hit point~[TAG_HIT_POINTS] damage, temporary ~ability damage~[TAG_ABILITY_DAMAGED], or effects that don't go away on their own. For example, if a poison has dealt 3 points of ~Constitution~[TAG_CONSTITUTION] damage to a character and threatens to deal more damage later, this spell prevents the future damage but does not repair the damage already done. The creature is immune to any poison it is exposed to during the duration of the spell.

It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects. First, the subject gains a +2 ~deflection~[TAG_DEFLECTION_BONUS] bonus to ~AC~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS] and a +2 resistance bonus on saves. Both of these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures. Second, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature or to exercise mental control over the creature (including ~enchantment~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_ENCHANTMENT] (charm) effects and enchantment (compulsion) effects that grant the caster ongoing control over the subject, such as ~Dominate Person~[TAG_SPELLS_DOMINATE_PERSON]). The protection does not prevent such effects from targeting the protected creature, but it suppresses the effect for the duration of the Protection from Evil effect. If the Protection from Evil effect ends before the effect granting mental control does, the would-be controller would then be able to mentally command the controlled creature. This second effect works regardless of alignment. Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. Good summoned creatures are immune to this effect. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. ~Spell resistance~[TAG_SPECIAL_ABILITIES_SPELL_RESISTANCE] can allow a creature to overcome this protection and touch the warded creature.

This decrease changes the creature's ~size~[TAG_SIZE_MODIFIER] category to the next smaller one. The target gains a +2 size bonus to ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY], a -2 size penalty to ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH] (to a minimum of 1), and a +1 bonus on ~attack rolls~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL] and ~AC~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS] due to its reduced size. A creature's size will be reduced to one category below the size that they were previously. For example, a Large humanoid creature will decrease to a Medium humanoid creature and then have a space of 5 feet and a natural reach of 5 feet (previously, the Large creature would have had a 10 foot reach; now it's 5, as a Medium creature). This spell doesn't change the target's speed. All equipment worn or carried by a creature is similarly reduced by the spell. Melee and projectile weapons deal less damage. For example, if the victim of the spell formerly had attack damage of 4d8, it will decrease to 4d6. Any reduced weapon that leaves the reduced creature's possession (including a projectile or ~thrown weapon~[TAG_THROW_WEAPON]) instantly returns to its normal size. But the reduced weapon will continue to deal less damage until the attack is complete. Multiple magical effects that reduce size do not stack, which means (among other things) that you can't use a second casting of this spell to further reduce the size of a humanoid that's still under the effect of the first casting. Reduce Person counters and dispels ~Enlarge Person~[TAG_SPELLS_ENLARGE_PERSON].

A space is rendered silent and the Silence spell stays only in that area.  The second target could be a creature, and the Silence spell actually moves with them, rather than staying solely in one area. The creature then cannot simply move away from the Silence spell. An unwilling creature can attempt a Will save to negate the spell and can use ~spell resistance~[TAG_SPECIAL_ABILITIES_SPELL_RESISTANCE], if any.

Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first. Among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell's point of origin are affected first. Hit Dice that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted. For example, Mialee casts Sleep at 3 kobolds (1/2 HD), 2 gnolls (2 HD), and an ogre (4 HD). All three kobolds and one gnoll are affected:                               (1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 + 2 = 3 1/2 HD)     The remaining 1/2 HD is not enough to affect the last gnoll or the ogre. Mialee can't choose to have Sleep affect the ogre or the two gnolls. ~Sleeping~[TAG_SLEEPING] creatures are ~helpless~[TAG_HELPLESS]. Slapping or wounding awakens an affected creature, but normal noise does not.

The weapon takes the shape of a weapon with some spiritual significance or symbolism to you and has the same threat range and critical multipliers as a real weapon of its form. It strikes the opponent as you designate, starting with one attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter on your turn. It uses your ~base attack bonus~[TAG_LEVEL_BONUSES] plus your ~Wisdom~[TAG_WISDOM] modifier as its attack bonus. It strikes as a spell, not as a weapon, so, for example, it can damage creatures that have ~damage reduction~[TAG_SPECIAL_ABILITIES_DAMAGE_REDUCTION]. The weapon always strikes from your direction. It does not get a ~flanking~[TAG_FLANKING] bonus or help a combatant get one. Your feats (such as ~Weapon Focus~[TAG_WEAPON_FOCUS]) or combat actions (such as ~charge~[TAG_CHARGE]) do not affect the weapon. If the weapon goes beyond the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the weapon returns to you and hovers. The Spiritual Weapon is capable of multiple attacks, provided that your base attack bonus allows you to do so. The Spiritual Weapon is a ranged weapon. It cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but ~Dispel Magic~[TAG_SPELLS_DISPEL_MAGIC] affects it. A Spiritual Weapon's ~AC~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS] against ~touch attacks~[TAG_TOUCH_ATTACK] is 12 (10 + size bonus for Tiny object). If an attacked creature has ~spell resistance~[TAG_SPECIAL_ABILITIES_SPELL_RESISTANCE], you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance every time the Spiritual Weapon attacks. The weapon that you get may be a force replica of your ~deity's~[TAG_RELIGION] own personal weapon, many of which have individual names. The weapons for each deity are listed in the entries for those gods. For example, the weapon of ~Moradin~[TAG_MORADIN] is noted as being a ~warhammer~[TAG_WEAPONS_WARHAMMER], aptly named "Soulhammer".

TAG_SPELLS_WEB	TAG_SPELLS		TAG_SORCERER_2 TAG_WIZARD_2	Web	~Conjuration~[TAG_MAGIC_SCHOOLS_CONJURATION] (Creation)Level: ~Sorcerer~[TAG_SORCERERS]/~Wizard~[TAG_WIZARDS] 2Components: V, SCasting Time: 1 ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION]Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)Effect: Webs in a 20-ft.-radius spreadDuration: 10 min./level (D)Saving Throw: ~Reflex~[TAG_REFLEX] negates; see textSpell Resistance: NoWeb creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands. These strands trap those caught in them. The strands are similar to spider webs but far larger and tougher. When casting the spell in ToEE, choose an area (20-ft.-radius) and the web will engulf that area. Creatures caught within a web or simply touching its strands become ~entangled~[TAG_ENTANGLED] among the gluey fibers. Anyone in the effect's area when the spell is cast must make a Reflex save. If this save succeeds, the creature is not entangled in the web and is free to act, though moving may be a problem. If the save fails, the creature is entangled. An entangled creature can break loose by spending 1 round and making a DC 20 ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH] check. Once loose (either by making the initial Reflex save or a later Strength check), a creature may progress through the web very slowly. Each round devoted to moving allows the creature to make a new Strength check. The creature moves 5 feet for each full 5 points by which the check result exceeds 10. If you have at least 5 feet of web between you and an opponent, it provides ~cover~[TAG_COVER]. If you have at least 20 feet of web between you, it provides total cover. The strands of a web spell are flammable. A magic flaming sword can slash them away as easily as a hand brushes away cobwebs. In ToEE, any fire damage dealt to creatures in the spell's area of effect will set the webs alight and burn them away. All creatures within flaming webs take 2d4 points of fire damage from the flames.

Only the affected creatures see the phantasmal creatures attacking them, though you see the attackers as shadowy shapes. If a subject's ~Fortitude~[TAG_FORTITUDE] save succeeds, it still takes 3d6 points of damage and is ~stunned~[TAG_STUNNED] for 1 round.

It is 2 feet thick and of considerable strength. It is a roaring blast sufficient to blow away any bird smaller than an eagle or tear light materials from unsuspecting hands. (A ~Reflex~[TAG_REFLEX] save allows a creature to maintain its grasp on an object.) ~Arrows~[TAG_WEAPONS_ARROWS] and ~bolts~[TAG_WEAPONS_BOLTS] are deflected upward and miss, while any other normal ranged weapon passing through the wall has a 30% miss chance. In ToEE, the radius of Wind Wall is 3 feet/level (maximum 30 feet).

Undead creatures are destroyed.Furthermore, if you are on your home plane when you cast this spell, nonchaotic extraplanar creatures within the area are instantly banished back to their home planes. Creatures so banished cannot return for at least 24 hours. This effect takes place regardless of whether the creatures hear the word of chaos. The banishment effect allows a Will save (at a 4 penalty) to negate.Creatures whose Hit Dice exceed your caster level are unaffected by word of chaos.

TAG_WEAPONS_LONGBOW_COMPOSITE	TAG_WEAPONS		TAG_ITEM_COMPOSITE_BOW	Longbow, Composite	You need at least two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size.  Composite longbows are made from two or more layers of horn, wood, or bone.  All composite bows are made with a particular ~strength~[TAG_STRENGTH] rating (that is, each requires a minimum Strength modifier to use with proficiency).  If your Strength bonus is less than the strength rating of the composite bow, you can't effectively use it, so you take a -2 penalty on attacks with it.  The default composite longbow requires a Strength modifier of +0 or higher to use with proficiency.  A composite longbow can be made with a high strength rating (representing an especially heavy pull) to take advantage of an above-average Strength score; this feature allows you to add your Strength bonus to damage, up to the maximum bonus indicated for the bow.  Each point of Strength bonus granted by the bow adds 100 gp to its cost.  For instance, a composite longbow (+1 Str bonus) costs 200 gp, while a composite longbow (+4 Str bonus) costs 500 gp.For example, Tordek has a +2 Strength bonus.  With a regular composite longbow, he gets no modifier on damage rolls.  For 200 gp, he can buy a composite longbow (+1 Str bonus), which lets him add +1 to his damage rolls.  For 300 gp, he can buy one that lets him add his entire +2 Str bonus.  Even if he paid 400 gp for a composite longbow (+3 Str bonus), he would still get only a +2 bonus on damage rolls and takes a -2 penalty on attacks with it because his Strength is insufficient to use the weapon to best advantage.  The bow can't grant him a higher bonus than he already has.For purposes of weapon proficiency and similar feats, a composite longbow is treated as if it were a longbow.  Thus, if you have ~Weapon Focus~[TAG_WEAPON_FOCUS] (Longbow), that feat applies both to longbows and composite longbows.Ranged WeaponTo Hit Bonus:               @t0 (see above)Damage:                          @t1d8 (see above)Damage Type:               @tPiercingCritical Range:             @t20/x3Range Increment:          @t110 feetWeapon Proficiency: @t~Martial~[TAG_MARTIAL_PROF], Longbow

Each bonus to the strength of a shortbow adds 75 gp to its cost.  For instance, a composite shortbow (+1 Str bonus) costs 150 gp, while a composite shortbow (+4 Str bonus) costs 375 gp.For purposes of weapon proficiency and similar feats, a composite shortbow is treated as if it were a shortbow.  Thus, if you have ~Weapon Focus~[TAG_WEAPON_FOCUS] (Shortbow), that feat applies both to shortbows and composite shortbows.Ranged WeaponTo Hit Bonus:               @t0 (see above)Damage:                          @t1d6 (see above)Damage Type:               @tPiercingCritical Range:             @t20/x3Range Increment:          @t70 feetWeapon Proficiency: @t~Martial~[TAG_MARTIAL_PROF], Shortbow

TAG_WEAPONS_SWORDS_OF_ANSWERING	TAG_WEAPONS		TAG_MAGIC_ITEMS TAG_MAGIC_WEAPONS	The Swords of Answering	The following information about the Swords of Answering has been gathered and compiled from bardic stories, old wives tales, and many such yarns.~Fragarach~[TAG_WEAPONS_FRAGARACH]     This hefty steel sword bears a mighty enchantment.  It was originally fashioned for a demigod of elsewhen, and eventually passed onto the Oerth.  It served well for a short time, all too soon falling into the hands of the minions of ~Chaotic Evil~[TAG_CHAOTIC_EVIL].  It has been in their grasp for over half a decade, resting in hiding in the Temple of Elemental Evil, guarded by the worst of elemental grues.  Fragarach means "The Answerer".     The sword is of ~Chaotic Good~[TAG_CHAOTIC_GOOD] alignment.  The sword functions perfectly only for a non-evil user.  In such hands, its +4 bonus always operates, and it will strike as many opponents as its possessor has the power to do so.  Fragarach always hits all such targets, the +4 pertaining to additional damage only.  Against evil opponents, the bonus doubles (to +8) if the wielder is ~Chaotic Neutral~[TAG_CHAOTIC_NEUTRAL], Chaotic Good, or ~Neutral Good~[TAG_NEUTRAL_GOOD].     The sword has a hilt of silver and gold wire, most cunningly wrought.  Its guard and pommel are set with 7 perfect emeralds.  Its scabbard is likewise trimmed with precious metal and decorated with many gems of green and golden hue.Other Swords of Answering     When Fragarach first came to this world, it received immediate attention and quick renown; so much so, in fact, that six other swords like it were forged and enchanted.  These are lesser weapons, of course, and their alignments vary.  These lesser swords are identified by the differing gems set in guard and pommel.  They are reported to be amethyst, aquamarine, garnet, peridot, topaz, and tourmaline stones.  These weapons are named Rebutter, ~Scather~[TAG_WEAPONS_SCATHER], Replier, Retorter, Squelcher, and Back-Talker, in honor of Fragarach.

The instruments can be used to play music to improve the effect of all ~bardic music~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_BARDIC_MUSIC] abilities.  Without these instruments, you must improvise sounds, and you take a -2 circumstance penalty on Perform checks.
TAG_BARDIC_INSTRUMENT_MAGICAL	TAG_TOOLS			Bardic Instrument, Magical	This instrument contains fine materials and components of better make, which grant a +2 or +3 circumstance bonus on ~Perform~[TAG_PERFORM] checks.Magical Instruments[CMD_CHILDREN_SORTED]
TAG_BOTTLES_OF_ACID	TAG_TOOLS			Bottles of Acid	There are several types of bottles of acid.  Each can be thrown as a ~dart~[TAG_WEAPONS_DART] weapon.Bottle                        DamageAcid                     @t1d6 acidDistilled Acid        @t1d6+6 acidEruptive Acid        @t1d6 acid and 1d6 firePurified Acid        @t2d6+6 acid
TAG_EYEGLASSES	TAG_TOOLS			Eyeglasses	A pair of eyeglasses grants the wearer a +2 circumstance bonus on ~Appraise~[TAG_APPRAISE] checks.Note: You don't want to forget to be careful when using them to keep an eye on unscrupulous shopkeepers.
TAG_FLASK_OF_OIL	TAG_TOOLS			Flask of Oil	This is a flask of combustable oil.  It can be thrown as a ~dart~[TAG_WEAPONS_DART] weapon, doing 1d6 fire damage on impact.
TAG_HEALER'S_KIT	TAG_TOOLS			Healer's Kit	A healer's kit is the perfect tool for healing and provides the owner a +2 circumstance bonus on ~Heal~[TAG_HEAL] checks.
TAG_HOLY_WATER	TAG_TOOLS			Holy Water	Holy water damages undead creatures and evil outsiders almost as if it were acid.  A flask of holy water can be thrown as a ~dagger~[TAG_WEAPONS_DAGGER] weapon.
TAG_LOCKSLIP_GREASE	TAG_TOOLS			Lockslip Grease	Lockslip grease lubricates locks and reduces the DC by 1 to ~pick~[TAG_OPEN_LOCK] the lock.  At its price, you would want it to work twice, so it does, but not on the same lock.
TAG_MERCHANT'S_SCALE	TAG_TOOLS			Merchant's Scale	A merchant's scale grants the owner a +2 circumstance bonus on ~Appraise~[TAG_APPRAISE] checks.
TAG_SCHOLAR'S_KIT	TAG_TOOLS			Scholar's Kit	A scholar's kit assists in the scribing of scrolls and provides the owner a +2 circumstance bonus on ~Spellcraft~[TAG_SPELLCRAFT] checks.
TAG_SMOKESTICK	TAG_TOOLS			Smokestick	This alchemically treated wooden stick instantly creates thick, opaque smoke when ignited.  The smoke fills the area (treat the effect as a ~Fog Cloud~[TAG_SPELLS_FOG_CLOUD] spell).  The stick is consumed after ignition and the smoke dissipates as the Fog Cloud spell ends.
TAG_SPYGLASS	TAG_TOOLS			Spyglass	Objects viewed through a spyglass are magnified to twice their size.  A spyglass allows the owner to have twice the chance of spotting a ~random encounter~[TAG_HMU_RANDOM_ENCOUNTER_UI].
TAG_THIEVES_TOOLS	TAG_TOOLS			Thieves' Tools	This kit contains the tools you need to use the ~Disable Device~[TAG_DISABLE_DEVICE] and ~Open Lock~[TAG_OPEN_LOCK] skills.  The kit includes one or more skeleton keys, long metal picks and pries, a long-nosed clamp, a small hand saw and a small wedge and hammer.  Without these tools, you must improvise tools, and you take a -2 circumstance penalty on Disable Device and Open Lock checks.
TAG_THIEVES_TOOLS_MASTERWORK	TAG_TOOLS			Thieves' Tools, Masterwork	This kit contains extra tools and tools of better make, which grant a +2 circumstance bonus on ~Disable Device~[TAG_DISABLE_DEVICE] and ~Open Lock~[TAG_OPEN_LOCK] checks.
TAG_UNHOLY_WATER	TAG_TOOLS			Unholy Water	Unholy water damages good outsiders the way ~holy water~[TAG_HOLY_WATER] damages undead and evil outsiders.  A flask of unholy water can be thrown as a ~dart~[TAG_WEAPONS_DART] weapon.
TAG_GOLDEN_SKULL	TAG_DUMMY			Golden Skull	The Orb of Golden Death, or the golden skull, grants the wielder the ability to cast the ~Discern Lies~[TAG_SPELLS_DISCERN_LIES] and ~Poison~[TAG_SPELLS_POISON] spells.  For each placed elemental gem, it will allow him to cast air, earth, fire, or water spells and to summon monsters.
TAG_ADVENTURING				Adventuring	Carrying Capacity: Each item in your character's ~inventory~[TAG_HMU_CHAR_INVENTORY_UI] or equipment has an associated weight to it. The carrying capacity of your character is based on the character's ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH], modified by 3/4 if the character is a ~gnome~[TAG_GNOMES] or ~halfling~[TAG_HALFLINGS].     Characters suffer penalties if carrying Medium or Heavy loads. These penalties include:  1. Limitations to the character's ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] bonus because of ~Encumbrance~[TAG_ADVENTURING_ENCUMBRANCE]  2. A check penalty on some ~skills~[TAG_SKILLS]  3. Reduction in the character's speed  4. Reduction in the distance a character can run in a roundMovement: Characters can move at the rate of a ~move~[TAG_ADVENTURING_MOVE] or ~run~[TAG_RUN].Exploration: All characters have a vision range dependant upon their character's ~class~[TAG_CLASSES]. In the game, this is represented by the fog, which hides any creature outside of the sight range. Characters should be put into a Marching Order or Formation, through the use of the ~in-game interface~[TAG_INGAME].Treasure and Other Rewards: Treasure is generally split up evenly between party members, and player characters can transfer items freely between themselves. However, some NPC's in the game require more or less treasure, or perhaps just particular items. Additionally, your character's actions are monitored in the game, and the party may pick up a reputation, which can be good or bad depending on the circumstances. Being coined the "Butcher of Hommlet" certainly wouldn't win you any friends in Hommlet, but might earn you some respect in the Temple.
TAG_ADVENTURING_MOVE	TAG_ADVENTURING			Move	~Humans~[TAG_HUMANS], ~Elves~[TAG_ELVES], ~Half-Elves~[TAG_HALF_ELVES], and ~Half-Orcs~[TAG_HALF_ORCS] move at a base speed of 30 feet, while ~Gnomes~[TAG_GNOMES], ~Dwarves~[TAG_DWARVES], and ~Halflings~[TAG_HALFLINGS] move at a base speed of 20 feet. A single move for a character means that the character will move this amount.[CMD_CHILDREN]
TAG_ADVENTURING_DOUBLE_MOVE	TAG_DUMMY			Double Move	A double move is fairly self-explanatory; your character is allowed to move twice the distance than he or she normally would.
TAG_ADVENTURING_ENCUMBRANCE	TAG_ADVENTURING			Encumbrance	Encumbrance rules determine how much a character's armor and equipment slow him or her down. There are three general weight categories for encumbrance: light, medium, and heavy     The computer will calculate your character's carrying capacity based on his or her ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH] score and the amount of weight being carried.The chart below can be used as a basic guideline for encumbrance.                   Max     Check           Speed            SpeedLoad         Dex      Penalty         (30 ft.)

However, their movement will drop to a rate of 5.A ~dwarf~[TAG_DWARVES] is immune to encumbrance penalties until he or she begins carrying a heavy load. So, a dwarf will continue having a ~movement rate~[TAG_MOVEMENT_RATE] of 20 ft. until they reach this level. However, once they begin carrying a heavy load, dwarves will only be allowed the usual movement rate of 5 for those encumbered at that level.
TAG_COMBAT				Combat	Combat takes place in rounds. If some of the combatants are unaware that hostilities have begun, those who are aware act in a ~surprise round~[TAG_SURPRISE] before the others. Combatants who have not had an action yet in combat are ~flat-footed~[TAG_FLAT_FOOTED].     Participants in combat first roll for ~initiative~[TAG_INITIATIVE]. The highest result will have the first action, and the other participants will follow in order, from highest to lowest. Ties are broken by comparing ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] scores. The higher Dexterity will go before the lower one in a tie.     The computer will handle all these rolls for you before combat begins by placing the combatants in order of initiative across the top of your screen.In a normal round, your character can perform a ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION] and a ~move action~[TAG_MOVEMENT_ACTION], or a ~full-round action~[TAG_FULL_ROUND_ACTION]. He or she can always substitute a move action for a standard action. ~Free actions~[TAG_FREE_ACTION] do not count toward either limitation.     In ToEE, actions are categorized as Standard, Move, Full, and Free. You can perform as many Free actions in a round as you wish.     In a single round, you can perform:     - a Full action     - a Standard action and a Move action     - two Move actions     Likewise, if you haven't physically moved in a round, you can perform a ~5-foot step~[TAG_5_FOOT_STEP]. This is an example of an action that does not fit neatly into any category; the 5-foot step and other such examples that are more difficult to classify are known as ~miscellaneous actions~[TAG_MISC_ACTION].In addition to the standard ~combat actions~[TAG_COMBAT_ACTIONS], there are ~special attacks~[TAG_SPECIAL_ATTACKS] and ~special initiative actions~[TAG_SPECIAL_INIT] that can be done.     Specifically, in ToEE, there are several combat options that are available through the use of the ~radial menu~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU], including the following:     ~Cast Defensively~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_CAST_DEFENSIVELY]     ~Deal Nonlethal Damage~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_NONLETHAL_DAMAGE]     ~Fight Defensively~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_FIGHT_DEFENSIVELY]For further descriptions of actual combat within ToEE, please see ~Combat and Game Play~[TAG_COMBAT_AND_GAME_PLAY] and ~Combat Actions~[TAG_COMBAT_ACTIONS].
TAG_ACTION_COST	TAG_COMBAT			Action Cost	[CMD_CHILDREN]
TAG_STANDARD_ACTION	TAG_ACTION_COST			Standard Actions	All of the following are considered standard actions:1.  Attack. An attack can be a standard ~melee attack~[TAG_MELEE_ATTACKS], an ~unarmed attack~[TAG_WEAPONS_STRIKE_UNARMED], which provokes an ~attack of opportunity~[TAG_AOO], or a ~ranged attack~[TAG_RANGED_ATTACKS]. Melee attacks can be done for ~nonlethal damage~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_NONLETHAL_DAMAGE] at a penalty on the ~attack roll~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL] and unarmed attacks can be done for lethal damage at a similar penalty. Some attacks might do extra damage as a result of a ~critical hit~[TAG_CRITICAL_HIT].2. Cast a spell. Most ~spells~[TAG_SPELLS] require a standard action as noted in their description. Casting a spell in an enemy's threat range provokes an attack of opportunity. Depending on distractions, a ~Concentration~[TAG_CONCENTRATION] check may also be required.3. Activate a ~magic item~[TAG_MAGIC_ITEMS].4. Use a special ability.5. ~Total Defense~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_TOTAL_DEFENSE]. This action gives your character a +4 dodge bonus to his ~AC~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS] for one full turn.6. Start/Complete a ~full-round action~[TAG_FULL_ROUND_ACTION]. A character restricted to standard actions only can spend his standard action to start a full-round action and complete it the next round during his standard action.
TAG_MOVEMENT_ACTION	TAG_ACTION_COST			Movement Actions	The following are considered to be move actions during combat:1.  Move. You may move your character up to his standard ~movement rate~[TAG_MOVEMENT_RATE]. Note that moving through or out of a threatened square provokes an ~attack of opportunity~[TAG_AOO].2. Draw or sheathe a weapon.3. Ready or loose a shield.4. Manipulate an item.5. Direct or redirect a spell. Some ~spells~[TAG_SPELLS] allow you to redirect the effect to new targets or areas after you cast the spell. Although this requires a move action, it does not provoke an attack of opportunity or require concentration.6. Stand up.
TAG_MOVEMENT_RATE	TAG_MOVEMENT_ACTION			Movement Rate	Movement rate is the speed at which your character moves, which may vary according to ~race~[TAG_RACES] and/or level of ~encumbrance~[TAG_ADVENTURING_ENCUMBRANCE]. ~Dwarves~[TAG_DWARVES], ~gnomes~[TAG_GNOMES], and ~halflings~[TAG_HALFLINGS] all move at a base land speed of 20 feet, while ~humans~[TAG_HUMANS], ~elves~[TAG_ELVES], ~half-elves~[TAG_HALF_ELVES], and ~half-orcs~[TAG_HALF_ORCS] all move at a base land speed of 30 feet.
TAG_FREE_ACTION	TAG_ACTION_COST			Free Actions	Free actions don't take any time at all and can be performed without limit. These are as follows:1.  Drop an item.2. Drop ~prone~[TAG_PRONE]. (Note: In ToEE, this action has not been implemented.)3. Speak. However, in ToEE, using the "~Talk~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_TALK]" command is a ~full-round action~[TAG_FULL_ROUND_ACTION] that usually can only be done ~Out of Combat~[TAG_OUT_OF_COMBAT].4. Cease ~concentration~[TAG_STOP_CONCENTRATION] on a spell.5. Cast a ~Quickened~[TAG_QUICKEN_SPELL] spell.
TAG_COMBAT_ACTIONS	TAG_COMBAT			Combat Actions	There are many actions a character can take during combat.  All actions have an ~action cost~[TAG_ACTION_COST].  Some actions provoke ~attacks of opportunity~[TAG_AOO].~Standard Actions~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION]~Movement Actions~[TAG_MOVEMENT_ACTION]~Free Actions~[TAG_FREE_ACTION]~Full-Round Actions~[TAG_FULL_ROUND_ACTION]~Miscellaneous Actions~[TAG_MISC_ACTION][CMD_CHILDREN_SORTED]See also:~Special Attacks~[TAG_SPECIAL_ATTACKS]~Special Initiative Actions~[TAG_SPECIAL_INIT]
TAG_COMBAT_AND_GAME_PLAY	TAG_COMBAT			Combat and Game Play	When entering combat, a row of character and monster portraits will appear at the top of the screen, in order of ~initiative~[TAG_INITIATIVE], which is determined by the computer.  On the left side of the screen, a bar will appear.  The combat system in the game translates the actions you have available into a numerical score and displays that score as a bar, with three colors.  The action bar, path movement, and the entries on the ~radial menu~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU] are all color coded as follows:Green:  An action can be performed, and you will still be able to attack afterward (for ~move actions~[TAG_MOVEMENT_ACTION]) or move afterward (for attacks).Yellow: An action can be performed, but you will not be able to attack afterward (for move actions) or move much (for attacks).Red: An action cannot be performed.Combat options that fall into the categories of ~full-round~[TAG_FULL_ROUND_ACTION], ~standard~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION], ~movement~[TAG_MOVEMENT_ACTION], and ~free~[TAG_FREE_ACTION] actions can be selected in the radial menu, provided you are still able to perform these actions (otherwise, they will be "greyed out" and you cannot select them).If you choose not to select anything from the radial menu, the only remaining option is simply to move the distance that the characters are allowed (for example, ~humans~[TAG_HUMANS] can move a maximum of 30 feet in a single move).
TAG_MODIFIER	TAG_COMBAT			Modifier	A modifier is any bonus or penalty applying to a die roll.  A positive modifier is a bonus, and a negative modifier is a penalty.Modifier Types~Ability Modifiers~[TAG_ABILITY_MODIFIERS][CMD_CHILDREN_SORTED]
TAG_ARMOR_BONUS	TAG_MODIFIER			Armor Bonus	A bonus to ~Armor Class~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS] granted by ~armor~[TAG_ARMOR] or by a ~spell~[TAG_SPELLS] or magical effect that mimics armor.  Armor bonuses stack with all other bonuses to Armor Class (even with natural armor bonuses) except other armor bonuses.  Magic armor typically grants an ~enhancement~[TAG_ENHANCEMENT] bonus to the armor's armor bonus, which has the effect of increasing the armor's overall bonus.  An armor bonus granted by a spell or ~magic item~[TAG_MAGIC_ITEMS] typically takes the form of an invisible, tangible field of force around the recipient.  An armor bonus doesn't apply against touch attacks, except for armor bonuses granted by force effects (such as the ~Mage Armor~[TAG_SPELLS_MAGE_ARMOR] spell) which apply against incorporeal touch attacks, such as that of a ~shadow~[TAG_MONSTER_SHADOW].
TAG_DEFLECTION_BONUS	TAG_MODIFIER			Deflection Bonus	A bonus to ~Armor Class~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS] granted by a ~spell~[TAG_SPELLS] or magic effect that makes attacks veer off harmlessly.  Deflection bonuses stack with all other bonuses to AC except other deflection bonuses.  A deflection bonus applies against touch attacks.
TAG_ENHANCEMENT_BONUS	TAG_MODIFIER			Enhancement Bonus	A bonus that represents an increase in the sturdiness and/or effectiveness of ~armor~[TAG_ARMOR] or natural armor, the effectiveness of a ~weapon~[TAG_WEAPONS], or a general bonus to an ~ability~[TAG_THE_ABILITIES] score.  Multiple enhancement bonuses on the same object (in the case of armor and weapons), creature (in the case of natural armor), or ability score do not stack.  Only the highest enhancement bonus applies.  Since enhancement bonuses to armor or natural armor effectively increase the armor or natural armor's bonus to ~AC~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS], they don't apply against touch attacks.The following is a list of available enhancements (and special abilities) to weapons and armor through the ~Craft Magic Arms and Armor~[TAG_CRAFT_MAA] feat:Weapon Enhancement+1+2+3Weapon Special Ability~Defending~[TAG_DEFENDING]~Flaming~[TAG_FLAMING]~Frost~[TAG_FROST]~Shock~[TAG_SHOCK]~Keen~[TAG_KEEN]~Mighty Cleaving~[TAG_MIGHTY_CLEAVING]~Flaming Burst~[TAG_FLAMING_BURST]~Icy Burst~[TAG_ICY_BURST]~Shocking Burst~[TAG_SHOCKING_BURST]~Holy~[TAG_HOLY]~Unholy~[TAG_UNHOLY]~Axiomatic~[TAG_AXIOMATIC]~Anarchic~[TAG_ANARCHIC]Armor Enhancement+1+2+3Armor Special Ability~Silent Moves~[TAG_SILENT_MOVES]~Spell Resistance (13)~[TAG_MAGIC_ARMOR_SPELL_RESISTANCE]
TAG_SHIELD_BONUS	TAG_MODIFIER			Shield Bonus	A bonus to ~Armor Class~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS] granted by a ~shield~[TAG_ARMOR_SHIELD] or by a ~spell~[TAG_SPELLS] or magic effect that mimics a shield.  Shield bonuses stack with all other bonuses to AC except other shield bonuses.  A magic shield typically grants an ~enhancement~[TAG_ENHANCEMENT] bonus to the shield's shield bonus, which has the effect of increasing the shield's overall bonus to AC.  A shield bonus granted by a spell or magic item typically takes the form of an invisible, tangible field of force that protects the recipient.  A shield bonus doesn't apply against touch attacks.
TAG_5_FOOT_STEP	TAG_COMBAT			5-foot Step	A small position adjustment that does not count as an action.  Usually, a 5-foot step is permitted at any point in the round (such as before or after a ~full-round action~[TAG_FULL_ROUND_ACTION], between attacks in a full attack, between a ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION] and a ~move action~[TAG_MOVEMENT_ACTION], or between two move actions).You can't take a 5-foot step:   - in the same round that you move any distance   - if your movement is hampered, such as into a square of difficult terrain, in darkness, or when ~blinded~[TAG_BLINDED]Taking a 5-foot step does not provoke an ~attack of opportunity~[TAG_AOO].
TAG_AOO	TAG_COMBAT			Attack Of Opportunity	A single extra ~melee attack~[TAG_MELEE_ATTACKS] per round that a combatant can make when an opponent within reach takes an action which provokes an attack of opportunity.  Actions which provoke attacks of opportunity include casting a spell, using a ranged weapon, and moving through a threatened area.In ToEE, all characters automatically make the first attack of opportunity which presents itself.
TAG_ARMOR_CLASS	TAG_COMBAT			Armor Class (AC)	Armor Class (AC) is a number representing a character's ability to avoid being hit in combat.  Higher numbers are better.An opponent's ~attack roll~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL] must equal or exceed the target's Armor Class to hit it.A character's Armor Class is 10 + all applicable modifiers (typically ~armor~[TAG_ARMOR_BONUS] bonus, ~shield~[TAG_SHIELD_BONUS] bonus, ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] modifier, and ~size~[TAG_SIZE_MODIFIER] modifier).
TAG_ATTACK_ROLL	TAG_COMBAT			Attack Rolls	When making attack, a twenty-sided die (1d20) is rolled to determine if you hit.  Your attack bonus is added to the roll.  If your roll equals or exceeds your opponents ~Armor Class~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS], you score a hit and roll damage.  If you roll a natural twenty, you may score a ~critical hit~[TAG_CRITICAL_HIT] and may inflict double damage or more.
TAG_CONCEALMENT	TAG_COMBAT			Concealment	Concealment encompasses all circumstances where nothing physically blocks a blow or shot but where something interferes with an attacker's accuracy.  If a defender has concealment, the attacker must pass a concealment check before an attacker is even allowed to make an ~attack roll~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL].  Some magical effects (such as ~Blur~[TAG_SPELLS_BLUR] and ~Displacement~[TAG_SPELLS_DISPLACEMENT]) provide concealment.Partial concealment gives the subject of an attack a 20% chance that the attack is an automatic miss.  If the attacker rolls higher than 20 percent, he has passed the concealment check but still has to hit with a standard attack roll.Total concealment occurs when the attacker can't see the target, for example when the attacker is ~blinded~[TAG_BLINDED] or the defender is ~invisible~[TAG_INVISIBLE].  An attacker attacking someone with total concealment has a 50% miss chance.If the attacker has the ~Blind-Fight~[TAG_BLIND_FIGHT] feat, he gets two chances to pass any concealment checks.
TAG_COVER	TAG_COMBAT			Cover	Targets which take cover behind a low obstacle or another creature get a +4 bonus to their ~AC~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS].You can view which creatures or objects are providing cover by holding down the left mouse button when attacking.  Cover is indicated by a red circle.
TAG_CRITICAL_HIT	TAG_COMBAT			Critical Hits	When you make an ~attack roll~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL] and get a natural 20, you hit regardless of your target's ~Armor Class~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS], and you have scored a threat.  The hit might be a critical hit.  To find out if it's a critical hit, you immediately make a critical roll--another attack roll with all the same modifiers as the attack roll you just made.  If the critical roll also results in a hit against the target's AC, you original hit is a critical hit.  If the critical roll is a miss, then your hit is just a regular hit.A critical hit means that you roll your damage twice, with all your usual bonuses, and add the rolls together.Some weapons have a threat range is greater than 20.  That is, you can score a threat on a lower number.  ~Longswords~[TAG_WEAPONS_LONGSWORD], for example, give you a threat on a natural attack roll of 19 or 20.  In such cases, a roll of lower than 20 is not an automatic hit.  Any attack roll that doesn't result in a hit is not a threat.Some weapons, such as ~battle axes~[TAG_WEAPONS_BATTLEAXE] and ~arrows~[TAG_WEAPONS_ARROWS], deal better than double damage on a critical hit.Bonus damage represented as extra dice, such as from a ~sneak attack ~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_SNEAK_ATTACK] or a ~flaming~[TAG_FLAMING] sword, is not multiplied when you score a critical hit.Some creatures, such as undead, are immune to critical hits.
TAG_DISMISS_SPELL	TAG_COMBAT		TAG_COMBAT_ACTIONS	Dismiss Spell	Dismissing an active spell is a ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION] that does not provoke ~attacks of opportunity~[TAG_AOO].
TAG_FLANKING	TAG_COMBAT			Flanking	When making a ~melee attack~[TAG_MELEE_ATTACKS], you get a +2 flanking bonus if your opponent is threatened by a character or creature friendly to you on the opponent's opposite side or opposite corner.When in doubt about whether two friendly characters flank an opponent in the middle, trace an imaginary line between the two friendly characters' centers.  If the line passes through opposite sides of the opponent's space (including corners of those sides), then the opponent is flanked.Exception: If a flanker takes up more than 1 square, it gets the flanking bonus if any square it occupies counts for flanking.Only a creature or character that threatens the defender can help an attacker get a flanking bonus.Creatures with a reach of 0 feet can't flank an opponent.
TAG_HELPLESS	TAG_COMBAT			Helpless	An opponent who is bound, ~sleeping~[TAG_SLEEPING], ~paralyzed~[TAG_PARALYZED], ~unconscious~[TAG_UNCONSCIOUS], or otherwise at your mercy is considered helpless.A helpless character takes a -4 penalty to ~AC~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS] against ~melee attacks~[TAG_MELEE_ATTACKS], but no penalty to AC against ~ranged attacks~[TAG_RANGED_ATTACKS].  A helpless defender can't use any ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] bonus to AC.  In fact, his Dexterity score is treated as if it were 0 and his Dexterity modifier to AC as if it were -5 (and a ~rogue~[TAG_ROGUES] can ~sneak attack~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ROGUE_SNEAK_ATTACK] him).As a ~full-round action~[TAG_FULL_ROUND_ACTION], you can use a melee weapon to deliver a ~coup de grace~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_COUP_DE_GRACE] to a helpless opponent.
TAG_INITIATIVE	TAG_COMBAT			Initiative	Your character's initiative is a number assigned by the computer that determines when you will take your turn in combat (as well as determining the order that everyone else will take their turns).
TAG_MELEE_ATTACKS	TAG_COMBAT		TAG_COMBAT_ACTIONS	Melee Attacks	With a normal melee weapon, you can strike any opponent within 5 feet.  (Opponents within 5 feet are considered adjacent to you.)  Some melee weapons have reach.  With a typical reach weapon, you can strike opponents 10 feet away and in ToEE, you can strike adjacent foes (those within 5 feet).  A melee attack is a ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION].In order to damage your opponent you must succeed at an ~attack roll~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL].
TAG_MULTIPLE_ATTACKS	TAG_COMBAT		TAG_COMBAT_ACTIONS	Multiple Attacks	If you get more than one attack per round because your ~base attack bonus~[TAG_LEVEL_BONUSES] is high enough, because you fight with ~two weapons~[TAG_TWO_WEAPONS], or for some special reason (such as a ~feat~[TAG_FEATS] or a ~magic item~[TAG_MAGIC_ITEMS]), you must use a ~full-round action~[TAG_FULL_ROUND_ACTION] to get your additional attacks.  You do not need to specify the targets of your attacks ahead of time.  You can see how the earlier attacks turn out before assigning the later ones.Each attack gets it's own ~attack roll~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL].
TAG_NORMAL_DAMAGE	TAG_COMBAT			Normal Damage	When your attack succeeds, whether it be with a weapon, a spell, or another form of combat, you deal damage.  Damage reduces a target's current ~hit points~[TAG_HIT_POINTS].
TAG_OUT_OF_COMBAT	TAG_COMBAT			Out of Combat	Out of Combat describes a spell casting time (or any action) that is anything longer than a round during combat.
TAG_RANGE_PENALTY	TAG_COMBAT			Range Penalty	The range penalty for a ranged weapon depends on the weapon and the distance to the target.  All ranged weapons have a range increment, such as 10 feet for a thrown ~dagger~[TAG_WEAPONS_DAGGER] or 120 feet for a ~heavy crossbow~[TAG_WEAPONS_CROSSBOW_HEAVY].  Any attack from a distance of less than one range increment is not penalized for range, so an ~arrow~[TAG_WEAPONS_ARROWS] from a ~shortbow~[TAG_WEAPONS_SHORTBOW] (range increment 60 feet) can strike at enemies up to 59 feet away with no penalty.  However, each full range increment cases a cumulative -2 penalty on the ~attack roll~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL].  A shortbow archer firing at a target 200 feet away takes a -6 penalty on his attack roll (because 200 feet is at least three range increments, but not four increments).
TAG_RANGED_ATTACKS	TAG_COMBAT		TAG_COMBAT_ACTIONS	Ranged Attacks	With a ranged weapon, you can shoot or throw at any target that is within the weapon's maximum range (see ~Range Penalty~[TAG_RANGE_PENALTY]) and in line of sight.  The maximum range for a ~thrown weapon~[TAG_THROW_WEAPON] is five range increments.In order to damage your opponent you must succeed at an ~attack roll~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL].
TAG_MELEE_SHOOTING	TAG_COMBAT		TAG_COMBAT_ACTIONS	Shooting or Throwing into a Melee	If you shoot or throw a ranged weapon at a target engaged in melee with a friendly character, you take a -4 penalty on your ~attack roll~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL] because you have to aim carefully to avoid hitting your friend.  Two characters are engaged in melee if they are enemies of each other and either threatens the other.  (An ~unconscious~[TAG_UNCONSCIOUS] or otherwise immobilized character is not considered engaged unless he is actually being attacked.)If your target (or the part of your target you're aiming at, if it's a big target) is at least 10 feet away from the nearest friendly character, you can avoid the -4 penalty, even if the creature you're aiming at is engaged in melee with a friendly character.If you have the ~Precise Shot~[TAG_PRECISE_SHOT] feat, you don't take this penalty.
TAG_SIZE_MODIFIER	TAG_COMBAT		TAG_MODIFIER	Size Modifiers	The smaller you are, the bigger other creatures are relative to you. A ~human~[TAG_HUMANS] is a big target to a ~halfling~[TAG_HALFLINGS], just as an ogre is a big target to a human.  Since this same size modifier applies to ~Armor Class~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS], two creatures of the same size strike each other normally, regardless of what size they actually are.Size / Size Modifier:Fine  (+8)Diminutive (+4)Tiny  (+2)Small  (+1)Medium (+0)Large  (-1)Huge (-2)Gargantuan (-4)Colossal (-8)
TAG_SPECIAL_INIT	TAG_COMBAT			Special Initiative Actions	Delay: If you would prefer for your character to move after someone else within the combat round, you can elect to Delay your action.  To do this, simply click and drag the character portrait at the top of the screen to the location in the order of when you would like that character to act.  However, if the character has already taken his turn, moving him to a lower ~initiative~[TAG_INITIATIVE] will not allow him to act again, and if he has not yet taken his actions for his turn, then moving him to an initiative higher than the current combatant will forfeit his turn for this round.Ready: You may also choose to Ready an action, dependent on something that the enemy does, such as prepare to cast a spell or shoot a bow.  In this case, as soon as the condition is achieved, the character will immediately enact his readied action.  If the condition is not achieved, then that character fails to act in that round.     For more information on Ready actions, see the ~Ready~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_READY] action list in the ~radial menu~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU].
TAG_STOP_CONCENTRATION	TAG_COMBAT		TAG_COMBAT_ACTIONS	Stop Concentration	You must concentrate to cast (or maintain) a spell.  If you are unable to concentrate, the spell can't be cast (or maintained).  If you start casting (or are maintaining) a spell but something interferes with your concentration, such as a creature taking an ~attack of opportunity~[TAG_AOO] to hit you with its club, you must make a ~Concentration~[TAG_CONCENTRATION] check or lose the spell.
TAG_SURPRISE	TAG_COMBAT			Surprise Round	In combat, if one or more characters gain surprise, they are allowed to act in the surprise round, before anyone else gets a chance to react.  Characters not acting in the surprise round are ~flat-footed~[TAG_FLAT_FOOTED].Characters are allowed to make one ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION] in the surprise round and as many ~free actions~[TAG_FREE_ACTION] as they want.
TAG_THROW_WEAPON	TAG_STANDARD_ACTION		TAG_COMBAT_ACTIONS	Thrown Weapons	Some weapons can be thrown as an attack.  If you hit, your ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH] bonus is applied to the damage.  All bonuses and penalties applicable to ranged weapons apply to the thrown weapon.  Throwing a weapon, like any other ~ranged attack~[TAG_RANGED_ATTACKS], incurs an ~attack of opportunity~[TAG_AOO].
TAG_TOUCH_ATTACK	TAG_COMBAT			Touch Attack	Touch attacks are used with spells that have a range of touch.  To use these spells, you cast the spell and then touch the subject.Since you need only touch your enemy, you make a touch attack instead of a regular attack.  Touching an opponent with a touch spell is considered to be an armed attack and therefore does not provoke ~attacks of opportunity~[TAG_AOO] when it is discharged on an armed opponent.  However, the act of casting a spell does provoke an attack of opportunity, so you may want to cast the spell and then move to the target instead of vice versa.Touch attacks come in two types:   -Melee touch attacks: for touches made with your hand   -Ranged touch attacks: for touches made with magic rays, for exampleSome touch attacks allow the caster to ~hold a charge~[TAG_HOLDING_A_CHARGE] of the spell.
TAG_FULL_ROUND_ACTION	TAG_COMBAT		TAG_ACTION_COST	Full-Round Actions	[CMD_CHILDREN]
TAG_FULL_ATTACK	TAG_FULL_ROUND_ACTION			Full Attack	A full attack allows you to use all of your attacks in a given round, if you have multiple attacks.  If you do not have multiple attacks, you do not need to use this attack.You may have multiple attacks because your ~Base Attack Bonus~[TAG_LEVEL_BONUSES] is high enough to allow it or you use ~two weapons~[TAG_TWO_WEAPONS] to fight.To make a full attack, select full attack from the ~radial menu~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU].  The number of attacks you have will be indicated by a number next to the cursor.  Click on an opponent to use an attack.  You may also use ~Trip~[TAG_TRIP], ~Stunning Fist~[TAG_STUNNING_FIST], ~Throw~[TAG_THROW_WEAPON], make a touch attack, or other actions from the radial menu which are equivalent to an attack.
TAG_CAST_FULL	TAG_FULL_ROUND_ACTION			Casting a Spell (Full Round)	Some spells require a full round to cast. Others may be cast in a full round, such as a ~bard~[TAG_BARDS] or ~sorcerer~[TAG_SORCERERS] choosing to make a ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION] spell a ~metamagic~[TAG_METAMAGIC] one.
TAG_USE_FULL	TAG_FULL_ROUND_ACTION			Use Special Ability (Full Round)	Depending on the special ability, some require a full-round action to execute.
TAG_WITHDRAW	TAG_FULL_ROUND_ACTION			Withdraw	You can move away from an opponent at double your ~movement rate~[TAG_MOVEMENT_RATE], without provoking an ~attack of opportunity~[TAG_AOO], using this a ~full-round action~[TAG_FULL_ROUND_ACTION].
TAG_RUN	TAG_FULL_ROUND_ACTION			Run	A character can run as a ~full-round action~[TAG_FULL_ROUND_ACTION] up to 4 times his or her normal ~movement rate~[TAG_MOVEMENT_RATE] in a straight line.  A character will run at 3 times his or her normal speed if they are wearing heavy armor.  Running provokes an ~attack of opportunity~[TAG_AOO].
TAG_SPECIAL_ATTACKS	TAG_COMBAT			Special Attacks	[CMD_CHILDREN]
TAG_AID_ANOTHER	TAG_DUMMY			Aid Another	In combat, you can help a friend attack or defend by distracting or interfering with opponents.  Select a friendly target.  That target gains a +2 bonus to his ~attack rolls~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL] until your next turn.You can also use this action to wake a friend under the influence of a ~Sleep~[TAG_SPELLS_SLEEP] spell.Aiding another is a ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION] which does not provoke an ~attack of opportunity~[TAG_AOO].
TAG_BULLRUSH	TAG_DUMMY			Bull Rush	To make a bull rush, you attempt to push an enemy back.You initiate this by moving into your opponent's square, which provokes an ~attack of opportunity~[TAG_AOO].Then you make opposed ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH] checks.  If you succeed, you can push your opponent back 5 feet.Note: In ToEE, the Bull Rush attack has not been implemented.
TAG_CHARGE	TAG_SPECIAL_ATTACKS			Charge	You move at least 5 feet or up to as much as double your normal speed directly toward your opponent.  You must have a clear straight-line path with nothing that can hinder your movement (such as difficult terrain or obstacles) toward the opponent.  After moving, you make a single attack, which results in a +2 bonus on the ~attack roll~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL].  You also take a -2 penalty to your ~AC~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS] until the start of your next turn.  A charge attack is a ~full-round action~[TAG_FULL_ROUND_ACTION].
TAG_FEINT	TAG_SPECIAL_ATTACKS			Feint	To feint, make a ~Bluff~[TAG_BLUFF] check opposed by a ~Sense Motive~[TAG_SENSE_MOTIVE] check by your target.  If your Bluff check result exceeds your target's Sense Motive check result, the next ~melee attack~[TAG_MELEE_ATTACKS] you make against the target does not allow him to use his ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] bonus to ~AC~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS].  A feint is a ~full-round action~[TAG_FULL_ROUND_ACTION].If you have the ~Improved Feint~[TAG_IMPROVED_FEINT] feat, a feint is a ~move action~[TAG_MOVEMENT_ACTION].
TAG_GRAPPLE	TAG_DUMMY			Grapple	Grappling means wrestling and struggling hand-to-hand.  It's tricky to perform, but sometimes you want to pin foes instead of killing them, and sometimes you have no choice in the matter.A grapple check is like a melee ~attack roll~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL].  Your attack bonus on a grapple check is:    ~base attack bonus~[TAG_LEVEL_BONUSES] + ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH] modifier + special size modifierThe special size modifier for a grapple check is as follows: Colossal (+16), Gargantuan (+12), Huge (+8), Large (+4), Medium (+0), Small (-4), Tiny (-8), Diminutive (-12), Fine (-16)     Use this number in place of the normal ~size~[TAG_SIZE_MODIFIER] modifier you use when making an attack roll.The steps to attempt a grapple are:1.  Provoke an ~attack of opportunity~[TAG_AOO].2. Perform a melee touch attack to grab the opponent.3. Make an opposed grapple check as a ~free action~[TAG_FREE_ACTION].If you succeed, your opponent is ~grappled~[TAG_GRAPPLING].Note: In ToEE, this attack has only been implemented for enemy creatures, such as a ~Giant Frog~[TAG_MONSTER_GIANT_FROG].
TAG_TRIP	TAG_SPECIAL_ATTACKS			Trip	To make a trip attack, make a melee touch attack against your target.  This provokes an ~attack of opportunity~[TAG_AOO] from your target.  If your attack succeeds, make a ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH] check opposed by the defender's ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] or Strength check (whichever has the higher modifier).  If you win, you trip the defender and he falls ~prone~[TAG_PRONE].  If you lose, the defender will immediately react and make a Strength check opposed by your Dexterity or Strength check to try to trip you.A combatant gets a +4 bonus for every ~size~[TAG_SIZE_MODIFIER] category he is larger than medium.  He gets a -4 penalty for every size category he is smaller than medium.  A defender gets a +4 bonus if he has more than two legs or is otherwise more stable than a normal humanoid (such as a ~dwarf~[TAG_DWARVES]).If you have the ~Improved Trip~[TAG_IMPROVED_TRIP] feat, you don't provoke an attack of opportunity for making a trip attack.Some creatures, such as those which fly or slither like a snake, cannot be tripped.
TAG_TURN	TAG_SPECIAL_ATTACKS			Turn or Rebuke Undead	Good ~clerics~[TAG_CLERICS], ~paladins~[TAG_PALADINS], and some neutral clerics can channel positive energy to halt, drive off (rout), or destroy undead.Evil clerics and some neutral clerics can channel negative energy to hold, awe (rebuke), control (command), or bolster undead.Regardless of the effect, the general term for the activity is called "~turning~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_CLERIC_TURN_REBUKE_UNDEAD]".
TAG_TWO_WEAPONS	TAG_SPECIAL_ATTACKS			Two Weapon Fighting	If you wield a second weapon in your off hand, you can get one extra attack per round with that weapon.  Fighting in this way is very hard, however, and you suffer a -6 penalty to your regular attack or attacks with your primary hand and a -10 penalty to the attack with your off hand.  You can reduce these penalties in the following ways:  - If your off-hand weapon is light, the penalties are reduced by 2 each.  - The ~Two-Weapon Fighting~[TAG_TWO_FIGHTING] feat lessens the primary hand penalty by 2, and the off-hand penalty by 6.
TAG_MISC_ACTION	TAG_COMBAT			Miscellaneous Actions	These actions do not fit neatly into any category. They are as follows:1. Take a ~5-foot step~[TAG_5_FOOT_STEP]. A character may make one 5-foot step per round, and you can't take a 5-foot step in a round when your character moves any distance. Taking a 5-foot step does not provoke an ~attack of opportunity~[TAG_AOO], but it is the only movement that character can do that round.1. Use a ~feat~[TAG_FEATS]. Each feat has its own dependencies for combat, and some are not allowed in combat at all. Refer to the feats list for detailed descriptions.2. Use a ~skill~[TAG_SKILLS]. Most skills require a standard action, but some may be different. Refer to the skills list for detailed descriptions.
TAG_RADIAL_MENU	TAG_INGAME		TAG_COMBAT TAG_INTERFACE_HELP	The Radial Menu	You can control your character's actions by use of the radial menu in the game.You can bring up the radial menu by right-clicking on the character of your choice. Spokes off the menu will guide you to your desired action. Simply move the cursor over the type of action you wish to perform and further spokes will extend out of the menu as necessary until your desired choice of action appears.     All actions are color coded during ~combat~[TAG_COMBAT], so that any that will complete actions for your turn (except ~free actions~[TAG_FREE_ACTION]) are yellow, any that will allow for further actions to take place are green, and any that are not allowed this turn are red.The radial menu features four icons (Sword, Person, Hammer & Anvil, and Backpack) from which the spokes emanate. The Hand icon will appear if your character has the feats that can be set or require activation. The Star icon will appear if your character is a spellcaster.1) Sword Icon:          Movement:                       ~5-foot Step~[TAG_5_FOOT_STEP]                       ~Break Free~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_BREAK_FREE]                       Flee Combat                       ~Move~[TAG_ADVENTURING_MOVE]                       ~Run~[TAG_RUN]                       ~Withdraw~[TAG_WITHDRAW]          Offense:                        ~Charge Attack~[TAG_CHARGE]                        ~Coup de Grace~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_COUP_DE_GRACE]                        ~Full Attack~[TAG_FULL_ATTACK]                        ~Reload~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_RELOAD]                        ~Single Attack~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION]                        ~Throw Weapon~[TAG_THROW_WEAPON]                        ~Trip Attack~[TAG_TRIP]                        ~Whirlwind Attack~[TAG_WHIRLWIND_ATTACK]          Options:                       ~Cast Defensively~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_CAST_DEFENSIVELY]                       ~Deal Nonlethal Damage~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_NONLETHAL_DAMAGE] or ~Deal Normal Damage~[TAG_NORMAL_DAMAGE]                       ~Fight Defensively~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_FIGHT_DEFENSIVELY]          Tactical:                        ~Feint~[TAG_FEINT]                        ~Ready~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_READY] (ready an action vs. an enemy action)                             ~Ready vs. Approach~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_READY_APPROACH]                             ~Ready vs. Spell~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_READY_SPELL]                             ~Ready vs. Withdrawl~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_READY_WITHDRAWL]                             ~Ready: Counterspell~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_READY_COUNTERSPELL]                        ~Total Defense~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_TOTAL_DEFENSE]2) Person Icon:     Clicking on this icon will make the "~Talk~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_TALK]" option appear. This is used as the primary way to talk to NPCs that join your party.     A ~barbarian~[TAG_BARBARIANS] can activate his ~Barbarian Rage~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARBARIAN_RAGE] ability.     A ~bard~[TAG_BARDS] can play any ~Bardic Music~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARD_BARDIC_MUSIC].     A ~cleric~[TAG_CLERICS] or ~paladin~[TAG_PALADINS] can ~Turn or Rebuke Undead~[TAG_TURN].     A cleric can also use a granted ~Domain~[TAG_DOMAINS] power.     A paladin can also use his ~Detect Evil~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_PALADIN_DETECT_EVIL], ~Lay on Hands~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_PALADIN_LAY_ON_HANDS], ~Remove Disease~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_PALADIN_REMOVE_DISEASE], or ~Smite Evil~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_PALADIN_SMITE_EVIL] abilities.     A ~druid~[TAG_DRUIDS] or ~ranger~[TAG_RANGERS] can bring forth an ~Animal Companion~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_ANIMAL_COMPANION].     A druid can also use her ~Wild Shape~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_DRUID_WILD_SHAPE] ability.     A ~monk~[TAG_MONKS] can set her ~Flurry of Blows~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MONK_FLURRY_OF_BLOWS] or use her ~Wholeness of Body~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MONK_WHOLENESS_OF_BODY] abilities.     A ~wizard~[TAG_WIZARDS] can copy scrolls into his ~spellbook~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_WIZARD_SPELLBOOK].     A ~sorcerer~[TAG_SORCERERS] or wizard can call or dismiss a ~familiar~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_CALL_FAMILIAR].3) Hand Icon:     Your character may use or set several feats: ~Combat Expertise~[TAG_COMBAT_EXPERTISE], ~Manyshot~[TAG_MANYSHOT], ~Power Attack~[TAG_POWER_ATTACK], ~Rapid Shot~[TAG_RAPID_SHOT], ~Stunning Fist~[TAG_STUNNING_FIST], ~Track~[TAG_TRACK], or any ~Item Creation~[TAG_ITEM_CREATION] feat4) Hammer & Anvil Icon:                       ~Heal~[TAG_HEAL]                       ~Sneak~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_SNEAK]                       ~Search~[TAG_SEARCH] (concentrated)     You can also use skills that require training, such as ~Disable Device~[TAG_DISABLE_DEVICE], ~Open Lock~[TAG_OPEN_LOCK], ~Sleight of Hand~[TAG_SLEIGHT] and ~Use Magic Device~[TAG_UMD].5) Star Icon:     Your character can cast Bard, Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger, Sorcerer, or Wizard ~spells~[TAG_SPELLS] for the corresponding class.     Your spellcaster might be able to use ~Dismiss Spell~[TAG_DISMISS_SPELL] or ~Stop Concentration~[TAG_STOP_CONCENTRATION] on an active spell.6) Backpack Icon:     Inventory: You will be able to select your character's ~inventory~[TAG_HMU_CHAR_INVENTORY_UI] and view your character's ~skills~[TAG_SKILLS], ~feats~[TAG_FEATS], spells, ~abilities~[TAG_THE_ABILITIES]; as well as view the character's items and basic stats.     You can also ~activate defending weapons~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_ACTIVATE_DEFENDING_WEAPON], ~set charges~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_STAFF_OF_STRIKING] on a magic weapon, activate magic weapons (such as a ~Dagger of Venom~[TAG_WEAPONS_DAGGER_OF_VENOM]), use ~magic items~[TAG_MAGIC_ITEMS], use potions, use scrolls, use wands, or summon a called familiar as a party member.
TAG_RADIAL_MENU_ACTIVATE_DEFENDING_WEAPON	TAG_INGAME			Activate Defending Weapon	A defending weapon allows the wielder to transfer some or all of the weapon's ~enhancement~[TAG_ENHANCEMENT_BONUS] bonus to his ~AC~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS] as a bonus that stacks with all others.  As a ~free action~[TAG_FREE_ACTION], the wielder chooses how to allocate the weapon's enhancement bonus at the start of his turn before using the weapon, and the effect to AC lasts until his next turn.
TAG_RADIAL_MENU_AUTOEND_TURN	TAG_DUMMY			AutoEnd Turn	AutoEnd Turn will conclude your turn if a ~5-foot step~[TAG_5_FOOT_STEP] is your only remaining option.  If you would like to take a 5-foot step as your last action in combat, be sure not to enable this option.
TAG_RADIAL_MENU_BREAK_FREE	TAG_INGAME		TAG_COMBAT_ACTIONS	Break Free	You can break free from a ~grapple~[TAG_GRAPPLING] by winning an opposed grapple check (see ~Grapple~[TAG_GRAPPLE]) in place of making an attack.  If more than one opponent is grappling you, your grapple check result has to beat all of their individual check results to escape.  If you escape, you finish the action by moving into any space adjacent to your opponent or opponents.You can also break free from being ~entangled~[TAG_ENTANGLED].  If you become entangled from a spell, such as ~Entangle~[TAG_SPELLS_ENTANGLE] or ~Web~[TAG_SPELLS_WEB], you can break free (see spell description).
TAG_RADIAL_MENU_CAST_DEFENSIVELY	TAG_INGAME			Cast Defensively	You may attempt to cast a spell while paying attention to threats and avoiding blows.  In this case, you are no more vulnerable to attack than you would be if you were just standing there, so casting a spell while on the defensive does not provoke an ~attack of opportunity~[TAG_AOO].  It does, however, require a ~Concentration~[TAG_CONCENTRATION] check to pull off.  Failure means that you lose the spell.
TAG_RADIAL_MENU_COUP_DE_GRACE	TAG_INGAME			Coup de Grace	As a ~full-round action~[TAG_FULL_ROUND_ACTION], you can use a melee weapon to deliver a coup de grace to a ~helpless~[TAG_HELPLESS] opponent.  You automatically hit and score a ~critical hit~[TAG_CRITICAL_HIT].  If the defender survives the damage, he must make a ~Fortitude~[TAG_FORTITUDE] save (DC 10 + the damage dealt) or die.~Asleep~[TAG_SLEEPING], ~paralyzed~[TAG_PARALYZED] or ~unconscious~[TAG_UNCONSCIOUS] opponents are all considered helpless.Delivering a coup de grace provokes ~attacks of opportunity~[TAG_AOO] from threatening opponents.A coup de grace is the best way to kill ~regenerating~[TAG_REGENERATION] monsters once they have become unconscious.
TAG_RADIAL_MENU_FIGHT_DEFENSIVELY	TAG_INGAME			Fight Defensively	As a ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION]:     You can choose to fight defensively when attacking.  If you do so, you take a -4 penalty on all attacks in a round to gain a +2 dodge bonus to ~AC~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS] for the same round.  This bonus stacks with the AC bonus granted by the ~Combat Expertise~[TAG_COMBAT_EXPERTISE] feat.As a ~full round action~[TAG_FULL_ROUND_ACTION]:     You can choose to fight defensively when taking a ~full attack~[TAG_FULL_ATTACK] action.  If you do so, you take a -4 penalty on all attacks in a round to gain a +2 dodge bonus to AC for the same round.
TAG_RADIAL_MENU_NONLETHAL_DAMAGE	TAG_INGAME			Nonlethal Damage	Sometimes you get roughened up or weakened, such as by getting clocked in a fistfight or tired out by a forced march.  This sort of trauma won't kill you, but it can knock you out or make you ~fatigued~[TAG_FATIGUED].If you take sufficient nonlethal damage, you fall ~unconscious~[TAG_UNCONSCIOUS] but you don't die.  Nonlethal damage goes away much faster than lethal damage does.Dealing Nonlethal Damage:     Certain attacks deal nonlethal damage, such as a ~human's~[TAG_HUMANS] ~unarmed strike~[TAG_WEAPONS_STRIKE_UNARMED].  Other effects, such as heat or being ~exhausted~[TAG_EXHAUSTED], also deal nonlethal damage.  Technically, nonlethal damage is not "real" damage (meaning it's not deducted from your current ~hit points~[TAG_HIT_POINTS]).  Instead, when your nonlethal damage equals your current hit points, you're ~staggered~[TAG_STAGGERED], and when it exceeds your current hit points, you fall unconscious.Nonlethal Damage with a Weapon that Deal Lethal Damage:     You can use a melee weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage instead, but you take a -4 penalty on your ~attack roll~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL] because you have to use the flat of the blade, strike at nonvital areas, or check your swing.Lethal Damage with a Weapon that Deals Nonlethal Damage:     You can use a weapon that deals nonlethal damage, including an unarmed strike, to deal lethal damage instead, but you take a -4 penalty on your attack roll because you have to strike only in the most vulnerable areas to inflict lethal damage.
TAG_RADIAL_MENU_READY	TAG_INGAME			Ready	You may also choose to ready an action, dependent on something that the enemy does, such as prepare to cast a spell or shoot a bow.  In this case, as soon as the condition is achieved, the character will immediately enact his readied action.  If the condition is not achieved, then that character fails to act in that round.List of Ready Actions[CMD_CHILDREN_SORTED]
TAG_RADIAL_MENU_READY_APPROACH	TAG_INGAME		TAG_RADIAL_MENU_READY	Ready vs. Approach	You may choose to ready versus an approach.  You can take a single ~standard~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION] or ~move~[TAG_MOVEMENT_ACTION] action (or any number of ~free actions~[TAG_FREE_ACTION]) when the next enemy creature enters your threat range.
TAG_RADIAL_MENU_READY_SPELL	TAG_INGAME		TAG_RADIAL_MENU_READY	Ready vs. Spell	You may choose to ready versus a spell.  You can take a single ~standard~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION] or ~move~[TAG_MOVEMENT_ACTION] action (or any number of ~free actions~[TAG_FREE_ACTION]) when the next enemy spellcaster attempts to cast a spell.
TAG_RADIAL_MENU_READY_WITHDRAWL	TAG_INGAME		TAG_RADIAL_MENU_READY	Ready vs. Withdrawl	You may choose to ready versus a withdrawl.  You can take a single ~standard~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION] or ~move~[TAG_MOVEMENT_ACTION] action (or any number of ~free actions~[TAG_FREE_ACTION]) when the next enemy creature attempts to exit your threat range.
TAG_RADIAL_MENU_READY_COUNTERSPELL	TAG_INGAME		TAG_RADIAL_MENU_READY	Ready: Counterspell	You may ready a counterspell against a spellcaster.  In this case, when the spellcaster starts a spell, you get a chance to identify it with a ~Spellcraft~[TAG_SPELLCRAFT] check (DC 15 + spell level).  If you do, and if you can cast that same spell (are able to cast it and have it prepared, if you prepare spells), you can cast the spell as counterspell and automatically ruin the other spellcaster's spell.If you have the ~Improved Counterspell~[TAG_IMPROVED_COUNTERSPELL] feat, to counter a spell, you may use a spell of the same school that is one or more spell levels higher than the other spellcaster's spell.A spellcaster can use ~Dispel Magic~[TAG_SPELLS_DISPEL_MAGIC] to counterspell, but it doesn't always work.
TAG_RADIAL_MENU_RELOAD	TAG_INGAME			Reload	You can reload ~bolts~[TAG_WEAPONS_BOLTS] into a ~light~[TAG_WEAPONS_CROSSBOW_LIGHT] or ~heavy~[TAG_WEAPONS_CROSSBOW_HEAVY] crossbow.  Loading a light crossbow is a ~move action~[TAG_MOVEMENT_ACTION] and loading a heavy crossbow is a ~full-round action~[TAG_FULL_ROUND_ACTION].  Both provoke an ~attack of opportunity~[TAG_AOO].
TAG_RADIAL_MENU_SNEAK	TAG_INGAME			Sneak	Sneak is an action that allows you to actively ~Move Silently~[TAG_MOVE_SILENTLY] and ~Hide~[TAG_HIDE] at the same time.  In order for someone to see you while you are sneaking, a ~Spot~[TAG_SPOT] check is needed.  The higher that your Hide skill is, the less likely they will be able to spot you.  Likewise, the lower your Hide skill, the more likely they will be able to spot you.  The same is true of moving silently while you're sneaking; a ~Listen~[TAG_LISTEN] check is needed to hear any of your movement and the skill level is measured accordingly.While in Sneak mode in the game, you visually appear to move slower, as if you are prowling.
TAG_RADIAL_MENU_TALK	TAG_INGAME			Talk	Using "Talk" in the ~radial menu~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU] will allow you to speak to NPCs.
TAG_RADIAL_MENU_TOTAL_DEFENSE	TAG_INGAME			Total Defense	You can defend yourself as a ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION].  You get a +4 dodge bonus to your ~AC~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS] for 1 round.  Your AC improves at the start of this action, so it helps you against any ~attacks of opportunity~[TAG_AOO] you incur during the round.  You can't combine total defense with ~fighting defensively~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_FIGHT_DEFENSIVELY] or with the benefit of the ~Combat Expertise~[TAG_COMBAT_EXPERTISE] feat (since both of those require you to declare an attack or ~full attack~[TAG_FULL_ATTACK]).  You can't make attacks of opportunity while using total defense.
TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS				Character Conditions	[CMD_CHILDREN_SORTED]
TAG_ABILITY_DAMAGED	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Ability Damaged	The character has temporarily lost 1 or more ~ability~[TAG_THE_ABILITIES] score points.  Lost points return at a rate of 1 per day unless noted otherwise by the condition dealing the damage.  A character with ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH] 0, ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] 0, ~Intelligence~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE] 0, ~Wisdom~[TAG_WISDOM] 0, or ~Charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA] 0 is ~paralyzed~[TAG_PARALYZED].  A character with ~Constitution~[TAG_CONSTITUTION] 0 is ~dead~[TAG_DEAD].     Ability damage is different from penalties to ~ability scores~[TAG_ABILITY_SCORES], which go away when the conditions causing them (~fatigue~[TAG_FATIGUED], ~entanglement~[TAG_ENTANGLED], etc.) go away.
TAG_ABILITY_DRAINED	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Ability Drained	The character has permanently lost 1 or more ~ability~[TAG_THE_ABILITIES] score points.  The character can only regain these points through magical means.  A character with ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH] 0, ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] 0, ~Intelligence~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE] 0, ~Wisdom~[TAG_WISDOM] 0, or ~Charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA] 0 is ~paralyzed~[TAG_PARALYZED].  A character with ~Constitution~[TAG_CONSTITUTION] 0 is ~dead~[TAG_DEAD].
TAG_BLINDED	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Blinded	The character cannot see.  He takes a -2 penalty to ~AC~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS], loses his ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] bonus to AC (if any), moves at half speed, and takes a -4 penalty on ~Search~[TAG_SEARCH] checks and on most ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH] and Dexterity-based ~skill checks~[TAG_USING_SKILLS].  All checks and activities that rely on vision (such as reading and ~Spot~[TAG_SPOT] checks) automatically fail.  All opponents are considered to have total ~concealment~[TAG_CONCEALMENT] (50% miss chance) to the blinded character.     Characters who remain blinded for a long time grow accustomed to these drawbacks and can overcome some of them.
TAG_CHARMED	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Charmed	As the subject of a charm spell (such as ~Charm Animal~[TAG_SPELLS_CHARM_ANIMAL], ~Charm Person~[TAG_SPELLS_CHARM_PERSON], or ~Charm Monster~[TAG_SPELLS_CHARM_MONSTER]), you essentially retain some form of free will, but make choices according to the suggestive powers of the spell.  Your mind may be clouded and you may suddenly be unable to tell friend from foe.  However, the spells do not render you ~helpless~[TAG_HELPLESS] and there are restrictions to what can be done, including the following:  - A charmed character retains his original ~alignment~[TAG_ALIGNMENT] and allegiances, generally with the exception that he now regards the creature who charmed him as a dear friend.  - A charmed character fights his former allies only if they threaten his new friend, and even then he uses the least lethal means at his disposal.  - A charmed character is entitled to an opposing ~Charisma~[TAG_CHARISMA] check against his master in order to resist instructions or commands that would make him do something he wouldn't do even for a close friend. If he succeeds, he decides not to follow that order but remains charmed.  - A charmed character never obeys a command that is obviously suicidal or grievously harmful to him.  - A charmed character who is openly attacked by the creature who charmed him or by that creature's apparent allies is automatically freed of the spell or effect.
TAG_CONFUSED	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Confused	A confused character's actions are determined by rolling d% at the beginning of his turn.  A confused character who can't carry out the indicated action does nothing but babble incoherently.  Attackers are not at any special advantage when attacking a confused character.  Any confused character who is attacked automatically attacks her attackers on her next turn, as long as she is still confused when her turn comes.  A confused character does not make ~attacks of opportunity~[TAG_AOO] against any creature that she is not already devoted to attacking (either because of her most recent action or because she has just been attacked).
TAG_COWERING	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Cowering	The character is frozen in ~fear~[TAG_FEAR] and can take no actions.  A cowering character takes a -2 penalty to ~AC~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS] and loses his ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] bonus (if any).
TAG_DAZED	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Dazed	The creature is unable to act normally.  A dazed creature can take no actions, but has no penalty to ~AC~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS].
TAG_DAZZLED	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Dazzled	The creature is unable to see well because of overstimulation of the eyes.  A dazzled creature takes a -1 penalty on ~attack rolls~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL].
TAG_DEAD	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Dead	The creature's ~hit points~[TAG_HIT_POINTS] are reduced to -10, his ~Constitution~[TAG_CONSTITUTION] drops to 0, or he is killed outright by a spell or effect.  The creature's soul leaves his body.  Dead creatures cannot benefit from normal or magical healing, but they can be restored to life via magic.  A dead body decays normally unless magically preserved (such as with the ~Gentle Repose~[TAG_SPELLS_GENTLE_REPOSE] spell), but magic that restores a dead creature to life also restores the body either to full health or to its condition at the time of death (depending on the spell or device).  Either way, resurrected creatures need not worry about rigor mortis, decomposition, and other conditions that affect dead bodies.     An undead creature or a construct is not at risk of death from massive damage, but when reduced to 0 hit points or less, it is immediately destroyed.  Undead, along with ~elementals~[TAG_MONSTER_ELEMENTAL] and non-native outsiders, are not affected by ~Raise Dead~[TAG_SPELLS_RAISE_DEAD] and ~Reincarnation~[TAG_SPELLS_REINCARNATION] spells or abilities.  Since it was never alive, a construct cannot be raised or resurrected.
TAG_DEAFENED	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Deafened	A deafened character cannot hear.  She takes a -4 penalty on ~initiative~[TAG_INITIATIVE] checks, automatically fails ~Listen~[TAG_LISTEN] checks, and has a 20% chance of spell failure when casting spells with verbal components.     Characters who remain deafened grow accustomed to these drawbacks and can overcome some of them.
TAG_DISABLED	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Disabled	A character with 0 ~hit points~[TAG_HIT_POINTS], or one who has negative hit points but has become stable and conscious, is disabled.  A disabled character may take a single ~move~[TAG_MOVEMENT_ACTION] or ~standard~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION] action each round (but not both, nor can she take ~full-round actions~[TAG_FULL_ROUND_ACTION]).  She moves at half speed.  Taking move actions doesn't risk further injury, but performing any standard action deals 1 point of damage after the completion of the act.  Unless the action increased the disabled character's hit points, she is now in negative hit points and ~dying~[TAG_DYING].     A disabled character recovers hit points from resting normally.
TAG_DISEASED	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Diseased	When a character is injured by a contaminated attack, touches an item smeared with disease matter, or consumes disease-tainted food or drink, he or she must make an immediate ~Fortitude~[TAG_FORTITUDE] ~saving throw~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC].  If the person succeeds, the disease has no effect--their immune system fought off the infection.  If the saving throw is failed, they take damage after an incubation period.  Once per day afterward, the character must make a successful Fortitude saving throw to avoid repeated damage.  Two successful saving throws in a row indicate that he has fought off the disease and recovers, taking no more damage.Typical diseases include the following:Blinding Sickness: Spread in tainted water.Cackle Fever: Symptoms include high fever, disorientation, and frequent bouts of hideous laughter. Also known as the "shrieks".Demon Fever: ~Night Hags~[TAG_MONSTER_NIGHT_HAG] spread it. Can cause permanent ~ability drain~[TAG_ABILITY_DRAINED].Devil Chills: ~Barbazu~[TAG_MONSTER_BEARDED_DEVIL] and ~Pit Fiends~[TAG_MONSTER_PIT_FIEND] spread it. It takes three, not two, successful saves in a row to recover from Devil Chills.Filth Fever: ~Dire Rats~[TAG_MONSTER_DIRE_RAT] and ~Otyughs~[TAG_MONSTER_OTYUGH] spread it. Those injured while in filthy surroundings might also catch it.Mindfire: Feels like your brain is burning. Causes stupor.Mummy Rot: Spread by mummies. Successful saving throws do not allow the character to recover (though they do prevent damage normally).Red Ache: Skin turns red, bloated, and warm to the touch.The Shakes: Causes involuntary twitches, tremors, and fits.Slimy Doom: Victim turns into infectious goo from the inside out. Can cause permanent ability drain.Disease                    DC          DamageBlinding Sickness @t16        @t1d4 ~Str~[TAG_STRENGTH]Cackle fever          @t16        @t1d6 ~Wis~[TAG_WISDOM]Filth fever           @t12        @t1d3 ~Dex~[TAG_DEXTERITY] and 1d3 ~Con~[TAG_CONSTITUTION]Mindfire              @t12        @t1d4 ~Int~[TAG_INTELLIGENCE]Red ache              @t15        @t1d6 StrShakes                  @t13        @t1d8 DexSlimy doom            @t14        @t1d4 Con
TAG_DYING	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Dying	A dying character is unconscious and near death.  She has -1 to -9 current ~hit points~[TAG_HIT_POINTS].  A dying character can take no actions and is ~unconscious~[TAG_UNCONSCIOUS].  At the end of each round (starting with the round in which the character dropped below 0 hit points), the character rolls d% to see whether she becomes stable.  She has a 10% chance of becoming stable.  If she does not, she loses 1 hit point.  If a dying character reaches -10 hit points, she is ~dead~[TAG_DEAD].
TAG_ENERGY_DRAINED	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Energy Drained	The character gains one or more negative levels, which might permanently drain the character's levels.     If the subject has at least as many negative levels as Hit Dice, he dies.  Each negative level gives a creature the following penalties:     -1 penalty on ~attack rolls~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL], ~saving throws~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC], ~skill checks~[TAG_USING_SKILLS], and ability checks     loss of 5 ~hit points~[TAG_HIT_POINTS]     -1 to effective level (for determining the power, duration, DC, and other details of spells or special abilities)     In addition, a spellcaster loses one spell or spell slot from the highest spell level castable.
TAG_ENTANGLED	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Entangled	The character is ensnared.  Being entangled impedes movement, but does not entirely prevent it unless the bonds are anchored to an immobile object or tethered by an opposing force.  An entangled creature moves at half speed, cannot ~run~[TAG_RUN] or ~charge~[TAG_CHARGE], and takes a -2 penalty on all ~attack rolls~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL] and a -4 penalty to ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY].  An entangled character who attempts to cast a spell must make a ~Concentration~[TAG_CONCENTRATION] check (DC 15 + the spell's level) or lose the spell.
TAG_EXHAUSTED	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Exhausted	An exhausted character moves at half speed and take a -6 penalty to ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH] and ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY].  After 1 hour of complete rest, an exhausted character becomes ~fatigued~[TAG_FATIGUED].  A fatigued character becomes exhausted by doing something else that would normally cause fatigue.
TAG_FASCINATED	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Fascinated	A fascinated creature is entranced by a supernatural or spell effect.  The creature stands or sits quietly, taking no actions other than to pay attention to the fascinating effects, for as long as the effect lasts.  It takes a -4 penalty on ~skill checks~[TAG_USING_SKILLS] made as reactions, such as ~Listen~[TAG_LISTEN] and ~Spot~[TAG_SPOT] checks.  Any potential threat, such as a hostile creature approaching, allows the fascinated creature a new ~saving throw~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC] against the fascinating effect.  Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a ranged weapon at the fascinated creature, automatically breaks the effect.  A fascinated creature's ally may shake it free of the spell as a ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION].
TAG_FATIGUED	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Fatigued	A fatigued character can neither ~run~[TAG_RUN] nor ~charge~[TAG_CHARGE] and takes a -2 penalty to ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH] and ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY].  Doing anything that would normally cause fatigue causes the fatigued character to become ~exhausted~[TAG_EXHAUSTED].  After 8 hours of complete rest, fatigued characters are no longer fatigued.
TAG_FEAR	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Fear	Any spell or magical effect that causes the victim to become ~shaken~[TAG_SHAKEN], ~frightened~[TAG_FRIGHTENED], ~panicked~[TAG_PANICKED], or to suffer from some other fear-based effect defined in the description of the specific spell, item, or creature in question.     If a fear effect allows a ~saving throw~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC], it is a ~Will~[TAG_WILL] save.  All fear attacks are mind-affecting effects.
TAG_FLAT_FOOTED	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Flat-Footed	A character who has not yet acted during combat is flat-footed and is especially vulnerable to attacks.  Characters remain flat-footed until their first turn in the ~initiative~[TAG_INITIATIVE] cycle.   A flat-footed character loses his ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] bonus to ~AC~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS] (if any) and cannot make ~attacks of opportunity~[TAG_AOO].     ~Barbarians~[TAG_BARBARIANS] and ~rogues~[TAG_ROGUES] have the ~Uncanny Dodge~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_UNCANNY_DODGE] extraordinary ability, which allows them to avoid losing their AC due to being flat-footed.
TAG_FRIGHTENED	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Frightened	Fearful of a creature, situation, or object.  A frightened creature flees from the source of its fear as best it can.  If unable to flee, it may fight.  A frightened creature takes a -2 penalty on all ~attack rolls~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL], ~saving throws~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC], ~skill checks~[TAG_USING_SKILLS], and ability checks.  A frightened creature can use special abilities, including spells, to flee; indeed, the creature must use such means if they are the only way to escape.     Frightened is like ~shaken~[TAG_SHAKEN], except that the creature must flee if possible.  ~Panicked~[TAG_PANICKED] is a more extreme state of ~fear~[TAG_FEAR].
TAG_GRAPPLING	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Grappling	Engaged in wrestling or some other form of hand-to-hand struggle with one or more attackers.  A grappling character can undertake only a limited number of actions.  He does not threaten any squares, and loses his ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] bonus to ~AC~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS] (if any) against opponents he isn't grappling.  See ~Grapple~[TAG_GRAPPLE].
TAG_HELD	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Held	Held characters are subjected to enchantments that make them unable to move.  They are ~helpless~[TAG_HELPLESS].  They can perform no physical actions (but they continue to breathe and can take purely mental actions).
TAG_HOLDING_A_CHARGE	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Holding a Charge	As a spellcaster, if you don't discharge a touch spell on the round that you cast it, you can hold the charge (postpone the discharge of the spell) indefinitely.  You can make ~touch attacks~[TAG_TOUCH_ATTACK] round after round.  You can touch a creature (or yourself) as a ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION].  If you touch anything with your hand while holding a charge, the spell discharges.  If you cast another spell, the touch spell dissipates.
TAG_INVISIBLE	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Invisible	Visually undetectable.  An invisible creature gains a +2 bonus on ~attack rolls~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL] against sighted opponents, and ignores its opponents' ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] bonuses to ~AC~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS] (if any).     Invisible creatures also gain the 50% automatic miss chance afforded by total ~concealment~[TAG_CONCEALMENT].
TAG_LEVEL_LOSS	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Level Loss	In ToEE, level loss is experienced by the character as a draining of ~experience points~[TAG_EXPERIENCE_AND_LEVELS], instead of simply losing a level.  For example, if a 6th-level ~fighter~[TAG_FIGHTERS] dies during combat, she will not automatically be dropped to 5th-level, but rather will lose an appropriate amount of XP.     This character condition can be countered with ~Restoration~[TAG_SPELLS_RESTORATION], which will restore the character with enough XP to put them at the minimum amount of their previous level.
TAG_NAUSEATED	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Nauseated	Experiencing stomach distress.  Nauseated creatures are unable to attack, cast spells, concentrate on spells, or do anything else requiring attention.  The only action such a character can take is a single ~move action~[TAG_MOVEMENT_ACTION] per turn.
TAG_PANICKED	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Panicked	A panicked creature must drop everything and flee at top speed from the source of its fear, as well as any other dangers it encounters, along a random path.  It can't take any other actions.  In addition, the creature takes a -2 penalty on ~saving throws~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC], ~skill checks~[TAG_USING_SKILLS], and ability checks.  If cornered, a panicked creature ~cowers~[TAG_COWERING].  A panicked creature can use special abilities, including spells, to flee; indeed, the creature must use such means if they are the only way to escape.     Panicked is a more extreme state of ~fear~[TAG_FEAR] than ~shaken~[TAG_SHAKEN] or ~frightened~[TAG_FRIGHTENED].
TAG_PARALYZED	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Paralyzed	A paralyzed character stands rigid, unable to move or act physically.  He has effective ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH] and ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] scores of 0 and is ~helpless~[TAG_HELPLESS], but can take purely mental actions.
TAG_PRONE	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Prone	The character is on the ground.  A character who is prone cannot attack, but he gains a +4 bonus to ~AC~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS] against ~ranged attacks~[TAG_RANGED_ATTACKS].  However, he also takes a -4 penalty to AC against ~melee attacks~[TAG_MELEE_ATTACKS].
TAG_SHAKEN	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Shaken	Mildly fearful.  A shaken character takes a -2 penalty on ~attack rolls~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL], ~saving throws~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC], ~skill checks~[TAG_USING_SKILLS], and ability checks.     Shaken is a less severe state of ~fear~[TAG_FEAR] than ~frightened~[TAG_FRIGHTENED] or ~panicked~[TAG_PANICKED].
TAG_SICKENED	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Sickened	The character takes a -2 penalty on all ~attack rolls~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL], weapon damage rolls, ~saving throws~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC], ~skill checks~[TAG_USING_SKILLS], and ability checks.
TAG_SLEEPING	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Sleeping	If you are the recipient of a ~Sleep~[TAG_SPELLS_SLEEP] spell, you fall into a magical slumber.  As a sleeping creature, you are ~helpless~[TAG_HELPLESS] and normal noise cannot be used to wake you.
TAG_STAGGERED	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Staggered	A character whose ~nonlethal damage~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_NONLETHAL_DAMAGE] exactly equals his current ~hit points~[TAG_HIT_POINTS] is staggered.  A staggered character may take a single ~move action~[TAG_MOVEMENT_ACTION] or ~standard action~[TAG_STANDARD_ACTION] each round (but not both, nor can he take ~full-round actions~[TAG_FULL_ROUND_ACTION]).
TAG_STUNNED	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Stunned	A stunned creature can't take actions, takes a -2 penalty to ~AC~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS], and loses his ~Dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] bonus to AC (if any).
TAG_TEMPORARY_HIT_POINTS	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Temporary Hit Points	Certain effects, such as the ~Aid~[TAG_SPELLS_AID] spell, give a character temporary hit points.  When a character gains temporary hit points, he should take note of his current ~hit point~[TAG_HIT_POINTS] total.  When the temporary hit points go away, such as at the end of the Aid spell's duration, the character's hit points drop to his current hit point total.  If the character's hit points are below his current hit point total at that time, all the temporary hit points have already been lost and the character's hit point total does not drop further.     When temporary hit points are lost, they cannot be restored as real hit points can be, even by magic.
TAG_TURNED	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Turned	Affected by a ~turn undead~[TAG_TURN] attempt.  Turned undead flee for 10 rounds (1 minute) by the best and fastest means available to them.  If they cannot flee, they ~cower~[TAG_COWERING].
TAG_UNCONSCIOUS	TAG_CHARACTER_CONDITIONS			Unconscious	Knocked out and ~helpless~[TAG_HELPLESS].  Unconsciousness can result from having current ~hit points~[TAG_HIT_POINTS] between -1 and -9, or from ~nonlethal damage~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_NONLETHAL_DAMAGE] in excess of current hit points.
TAG_SPECIAL_ABILITIES				Creature Special Abilities	A special ability is either extraordinary, spell-like, or supernatural in nature.  - Extraordinary abilities are nonmagical.  A ~monk's~[TAG_MONKS] ability to ~evade~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_MONK_EVASION] attacks and a ~barbarian's~[TAG_BARBARIANS] ~uncanny dodge~[TAG_CLASS_FEATURES_BARBARIAN_UNCANNY_DODGE] are extraordinary abilities.  - Spell-like abilities, as the name implies, are spells and magical abilities that are very much like spells.  Spell-like abilities are subject to spell resistance and ~Dispel Magic~[TAG_SPELLS_DISPEL_MAGIC].  - Supernatural abilities are not subject to spell resistance and do not function in areas where magic is suppressed or negated.[CMD_CHILDREN_SORTED]
TAG_SPECIAL_ABILITIES_ABILITY_SCORE_LOSS 	TAG_SPECIAL_ABILITIES			Ability Score Loss	Various attacks cause ~ability score~[TAG_ABILITY_SCORES] loss, either ~ability damage~[TAG_ABILITY_DAMAGED] or ~ability drain~[TAG_ABILITY_DRAINED].  Points lost to ability damage return at the rate of 1 point per day (or double that if the character gets complete bed rest) to each damaged ability, and the spell ~Lesser Restoration~[TAG_SPELLS_RESTORATION_LESSER] offsets ability damage as well.  Ability drain, however, is permanent, though ~Restoration~[TAG_SPELLS_RESTORATION] can restore even those lost ability points.     Having a score of 0 in an ability is different from having no ability score whatsoever.  For example, a wraith has no ~Strength~[TAG_STRENGTH] score, not a Strength score of 0.  The wraith can move, it just can't act physically on other objects.     Some spells or abilities impose an effective ability score reduction, which is different than ability score loss.  Any such reduction disappears at the end of the spell's or ability's duration, and the ability score immediately returns to its former value.     If a character's ~Constitution~[TAG_CONSTITUTION] score drops, then he or she loses 1 ~hit point~[TAG_HIT_POINTS] per Hit Die for every point by which his or her Constitution modifier drops.
TAG_SPECIAL_ABILITIES_DAMAGE_REDUCTION	TAG_SPECIAL_ABILITIES			Damage Reduction	Some magic creatures have the supernatural ability to instantly heal damage from weapons or to ignore blows altogether as though they were invulnerable.     The numerical part of a creature's damage reduction is the amount of ~hit points~[TAG_HIT_POINTS] the creature ignores from normal attacks.  Thus, a creature with a damage reduction number of 5 that is struck for 8 points of damage will ignore 5 points and take only 3 points of damage.     Usually, a certain type of weapon can overcome this reduction. This information is separated from the damage reduction by a slash. For example, a ~Salamander's~[TAG_MONSTER_SALAMANDER_AVERAGE] damage reduction is 10/magic, meaning the Salamander ignores the first 10 points of damage from every normal attack unless it is made with a magic weapon. If a dash follows the slash (for example, a ~Large Air Elemental~[TAG_MONSTER_ELEMENTAL_AIR_LARGE] has a DR of 5/-), then the damage reduction is effective against any attack that does not ignore damage reduction.
TAG_SPECIAL_ABILITIES_ENERGY_DRAIN_AND_NEGATIVE_LEVELS	TAG_SPECIAL_ABILITIES			Energy Drain and Negative Levels	Some horrible creatures, especially undead monsters, possess a fearsome supernatural ability to drain levels from those they strike in combat.  The creature making an energy drain attack draws a portion of its victim's life force from him.     Most energy drain attacks require a successful melee ~attack roll~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL]--mere physical contact is not enough.  ~Monks~[TAG_MONKS], for instance, can pound such creatures with their fists without risking their life energy.     Each successful energy drain attack bestows one or more negative levels on the opponent.  A creature takes the following penalties for each negative level it has gained:     -1 on all ~skill~[TAG_USING_SKILLS] and ability checks     -1 on attack rolls and ~saving throws~[TAG_SAVING_THROW_DESC]     -5 ~hit points~[TAG_HIT_POINTS]     -1 effective level     Negative levels remain for 24 hours or until removed with a spell, such as ~Restoration~[TAG_SPELLS_RESTORATION].  After 24 hours, the afflicted creature must attempt a ~Fortitude~[TAG_FORTITUDE] save.  If the saving throw succeeds, the negative level goes away with no harm to the creature.  The afflicted creature makes a separate saving throw for each negative level it has gained.  If the save fails, the negative level goes away, but the creature's level is also reduced by one.
TAG_SPECIAL_ABILITIES_FAST_HEALING	TAG_SPECIAL_ABILITIES			Fast Healing	A creature may have the extraordinary ability to regain ~hit points~[TAG_HIT_POINTS] at an exceptional rate.     At the beginning of each of the creature's turns, it heals a certain number of hit points.     Unlike ~regeneration~[TAG_REGENERATION], fast healing does not allow a creature to regrow or reattach lost body parts.     A creature that has taken both ~nonlethal~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_NONLETHAL_DAMAGE] and ~lethal~[TAG_NORMAL_DAMAGE] damage heals the nonlethal damage first.

TAG_REGENERATION	TAG_SPECIAL_ABILITIES			Regeneration	Creatures with this extraordinary ability recover from wounds quickly and can even regrow or reattach severed limbs.     Damage dealt to this creature is treated as ~nonlethal damage~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_NONLETHAL_DAMAGE] and the creature automatically cures itself of nonlethal damage at a fixed rate (for example, 5 points per round for a ~troll~[TAG_MONSTER_TROLL]).     Certain attack forms, typically fire and acid, deal damage to the creature normally; that sort of damage doesn't convert to nonlethal damage and so doesn't go away.     Delivering a ~coup de grace~[TAG_RADIAL_MENU_COUP_DE_GRACE] has a chance of severing the creature's head, killing the creature instantly.
TAG_SPECIAL_ABILITIES_RESISTANCE_TO_ENERGY	TAG_SPECIAL_ABILITIES			Resistance to Energy	A creature with resistance to energy has the ability (usually extraordinary) to ignore some damage of a certain type (such as cold, electricity, or fire) each round, but it does not have total immunity.     Each resistance ability is defined by what energy type it resists and how many points of damage are resisted.  For example, a ~Janni~[TAG_MONSTER_JANNI] has resistance to fire 10.  A Janni can ignore the first 10 points of fire damage it takes each attack.  It doesn't matter whether the damage has a mundane or magical source.     When resistance completely negates the damage from an energy attack, the attack does not disrupt a spell.     This resistance does not stack with the resistance that a spell, such as ~Endure Elements~[TAG_SPELLS_ENDURE_ELEMENTS], might provide.
TAG_SPECIAL_ABILITIES_SPELL_RESISTANCE	TAG_SPECIAL_ABILITIES			Spell Resistance 	Spell resistance is the extraordinary ability to avoid being affected by spells.  (Some ~spells~[TAG_SPELLS_SPELL_RESISTANCE] also grant spell resistance.)     To affect a creature that has spell resistance, a spellcaster must make a ~caster level~[TAG_CASTER_LEVEL] check at least equal to the creature's spell resistance.  If the caster fails the check, the spell doesn't affect the creature.     Only spells and spell-like abilities are subject to spell resistance.  Extraordinary and supernatural abilities (including ~enhancement~[TAG_ENHANCEMENT_BONUS] bonuses on magic weapons) are not.  A ~cleric's~[TAG_CLERICS] spells are subject to spell resistance, but his use of positive or negative energy is not.

Resting will allow you to regain your health, memorize spells, or just let time pass.  You can choose to rest for any amount of time.The rest icon changes colors to indicate if resting is possible or not.  Red means you cannot rest here.  Yellow means you may rest here, but it is dangerous and you might get attacked while you are sleeping.  Green means that this is a safe place and you may rest for any amount of time.Sometimes the rest icon will change from a tent to a stop-watch.  The stop-watch icon indicates that you can only pass-time here.  While passing time you will not regain spells or health, but you will not get attacked either.Spellcasters like Ariel need 8 hours of rest in order to regain their spells.  The rest icon is green, indicating we are in a safe area, so let's rest.

TAG_TUT_OPEN_CHEST	TAG_TUT_ROOT			Tutorial: Open Chest	With your character selected, left-click on the chest and you will walk over and try to open it.
TAG_TUT_DIALOGUE	TAG_TUT_ROOT			Tutorial: Dialogue	You have discovered another adventurer in the dungeon.  This particular one wants to talk to you immediately, so the dialogue interface will come up right away.  Normally, you would have to select a party member, and then left-click on the person/creature you wish to talk to.This interface has two windows.  The top is what the other person is saying, and the bottom is your list of potential responses.  Left-click on a line of dialogue to respond.
TAG_TUT_MOVEMENT	TAG_TUT_ROOT			Tutorial: Movement	In combat, movement is color-coded. When you click to move different places, you will see these colors, which will help you understand what you can and cannot do.Green: You can still move and perform an action.Yellow: Moving is your action and you are unable to do any other actions. Once you can move no further, your character will stop, regardless of where you try to click. 
TAG_TUT_COMBAT_ACTION_BAR	TAG_TUT_ROOT			Tutorial: Combat and the Action Bar	The Action Bar, on the left side of the game screen, shows how much time you have to perform actions during your turn.  Every action costs a certain amount of "time".If you move your cursor along the ground, you can see how much time that move will cost if you choose to left-click and walk there.  If you hover over an enemy, your cursor will change to an attack cursor and the action bar will display how much time it would it take to left-click and attack them.In general, if you keep the bar in the green (above the middle line) you will be able to attack or cast a spell.  If you go into the yellow (below the middle line) you are choosing to do nothing but move the rest of your turn.If the bar is red, it means that this action would take more time than you currently have available.If you use all of your time up, your turn will end automatically.  If you still have some time left and wish to end your turn, you can click on the "end turn button" beneath the action bar or just hit the "enter" key on your keyboard.
TAG_TUT_SELECT_CHARACTER	TAG_TUT_ROOT			Tutorial: Select Character	You can have up to 8 adventurers in your party.  In this tutorial, you only have one... for now.  When a character is selected, you will see a blue selection ring around him and his portrait beneath.  To select a character within your party, you can:-Press numbers 1-8. Each number corresponds with a specific character in the party.-Left-click and drag to form a square around the character or characters.-Left-click on the character.To move your character:-Left-click anywhere on the ground and your character will move there.  If you have clicked on a location that he cannot find a path to, you will see a flashing circle where you have clicked.
TAG_TUT_CAST_SPELLS	TAG_TUT_ROOT			Tutorial: Choosing Spell to Cast	You don't have to wait for a creature to see you in order for combat to begin.  Sometimes it is best to draw first blood!  If Ariel has memorized her Magic Missile, now would be a perfect time to cast it.  Make sure Ariel has a clear line of site to the zombies and then do the following: -Left-click on Ariel once to make sure she alone is selected. -Right-click to open her radial menu, and then hover over the spell icon that looks like a glowing ball of light. -Hover over the class "wiz" and then spell level, which in this case is level "1".-Left-click on Magic Missile.If you don't have any spells memorized you can charge in and hope for the best, but I would recommend trying to memorize her Magic Missile spell.
TAG_TUT_COMBAT_INITIATIVE_BAR	TAG_TUT_ROOT			Tutorial: Combat Initiative Bar	Combat with a giant rat has begun!  Combat is based on turns and the first thing that needs to be determined is who goes first.  This is called "initiative".  A higher initiative score means you will go before someone with a lower score.  At the top of the game screen during combat, there will be a row of portraits consisting of  your party and all other creatures involved in combat.  A blue border highlights the portrait of the character whose turn it is.  The portraits are listed from left to right in order of initiative.  Once the character on the end of the initiative bar takes his turn, the round is over and a new one begins.Creatures will automatically act when they get the chance, but when it comes to your turn, you will have to tell your character where to go and who to attack.Info:  Hovering over the portrait as well as the creature itself, displays the creature's current condition.
TAG_TUT_COMBAT_ATTACKING	TAG_TUT_ROOT			Tutorial: Attacking	If your character is standing away from the creature, you will need to click to move next to the creature. Then, you can click on the creature and your character will attack. If your character is standing beside the creature, click on the creature and your character will perform a full attack.The Action bar will inform you of whether or not these actions are possible. For example, if you move a great distance, you will not be able to attack the creature once you get there, as this will be an action you will have to save for your next turn.
TAG_TUT_KEYS	TAG_TUT_ROOT			Tutorial: The Logbook and Your Keys	Unlike all other items in the game, keys do not go into personal character inventories, but instead become group communal property listed in the Logbook. The Logbook keeps your quests, keys, and all kinds of stats about your gameplay.  The Logbook can be found on the utility bar in the bottom right corner of the game screen. It is the icon that shows a book.  To check out where the key went that you just looted from the rat, do the following.-Left-click on the Logbook icon and you will see a few different tabs; one of these is the tab for Keys. -Left-click on the Key tab and it will open the Keys interface, which will show all keys you have found on the left, and information on the particular selected key on the right. -When you want to exit the logbook, just left-click on the red exit arrow in the lower right hand corner of the interface.
TAG_TUT_TRADE_ITEMS	TAG_TUT_ROOT			Tutorial: Trade Items	At this point, you may want to consider giving the Wand of Fireballs that you found on the corpse to Ariel. She is the spellcaster and you are a fighter. As a fighter, you are unable to use wands. In the game, it will generally be more advantageous for certain classes and types of characters to use specific items and this is one example of that. To trade items between players:-Right click on your character to open the radial menu and then your inventory, or right click on your character portrait to open your inventory, to give the Wand of Fireballs to Ariel. -Click and drag the wand in your inventory onto Ariel's character portrait so that she will receive the item in her inventory.-Open Ariel's inventory and the wand is now available for her to use.
TAG_TUT_USE_POTION	TAG_TUT_ROOT			Tutorial: Use Potion	One way of healing a character who has taken damage is to use a potion.To use a potion to heal:-Right click on the character who will perform the healing (e.g. a wizard) to open the radial menu.-Click on the Inventory icon (backpack) which will bring up an option for Potions.-Click on Potions and select a potion of healing, such as Cure Light or Cure Moderate.-Then, a target selection circle will appear, and your character will either target someone else to heal or target themselves. -Click on the target and the player's HP will increase accordingly.
TAG_TUT_MEMORIZE_SPELLS	TAG_TUT_ROOT			Tutorial: Memorize Spells	You now have a wizard in your party!  Spellcasters typically have a bank of spells that they can choose from when casting spells.  Every spellcaster only gets a certain amount of those spells to cast in a day.  They have to choose which ones they want to memorize, and then rest 8 hours to learn them.Here is what you need to do have Ariel memorize her spells:-Left-click on Ariel to make sure she is the only character selected.-Right-click to open her radial menu, hover over the backpack icon, and then select Inventory.-On the top right side of the inventory interface, you will see a tab/icon that looks like a glowing spell effect.  -Left-click on this tab. On the left side, is a list of known spells. On the right side, is the list of memorized (and therefore, usable) spells.-Left-click and drag Magic Missile from the left to one of the available Spell Level 1 slots on the right.Left-click the red exit arrow when you are finished.
TAG_TUT_PASSAGE_ICON	TAG_TUT_ROOT			Tutorial: Passage Icon	You will see a small icon near the ladder in the center of the room.  This is known as a passage icon. Left-clicking on this icon will transfer you to another area.You will find these icons by doors, ladders, and passageways.
TAG_TUT_LOOTING	TAG_TUT_ROOT			Tutorial: Looting	You have killed a rat!  To loot items from a dead creature is the same as looting a chest.  Once the creature has been killed, you can click on his dead body to see if he has any items of value.  In this case, our rat has a key that we will need to open the locked door to the northeast.To loot the golden key from the dead rat:-Left-Click on the dead creature and the loot screen will appear that shows all of the items in its possession.-Left-click and drag the key from the rat's inventory to your own. -A window will pop up, informing you that the key is automatically transferred to the party's logbook, where it will be found in the keys section for future use by the entire party.-Close the loot screen by clicking on the red exit arrow in the lower right hand corner of the interface.
TAG_TUT_LOOTING_SWORD	TAG_TUT_ROOT			Tutorial: Looting and Equipping	Now that the chest is open, you will see the looting interface for the chest and your character's inventory interface. The looting interface will be on the left side and you will see a sword and shield filling two of the slots. Left-click on the sword and hold the button down to grab the sword.  Now drag the sword icon to an empty slot in your character's inventory and release the button.  Repeat the process for the shield.To equip your new sword and shield:Left-click the sword and drag it from a slot on the right side of your character's inventory into a weapon slot (which has a greyed out sword in it).  Now grab your shield and place it in the shield slot.  Once you are finished equipping your new items, click the red exit arrow in the lower right-hand corner of the interface.  This will return you to the game.Note:  right-clicking on an item in a chest instantly transfers it to your back-pack.  Right-clicking on an item in your back-pack instantly equips the item for you!
TAG_TUT_MULTIPLE_CHARACTERS	TAG_TUT_ROOT			Tutorial: Moving Multiple Party Members	Now that Ariel has memorized her spells, you should adventure deeper into the dungeon.  Since you joined forces with Ariel, you have two members in your party instead of one.To select all of your characters and move them at the same time:-Left-Click and drag a selection square around both characters.-You can also left-click the select-all button on your utility bar in the lower right hand corner of the screen.  The button is the large one on the left showing three people surrounded by a circle.Once you have the entire party selected, click on the ground as usual to move them in unison.
TAG_TUT_PICKLOCK	TAG_TUT_ROOT			Tutorial: Picklock the Chest	The chest is locked!  When a chest or door is locked you will see the text "locked" float above it.  Since you don't have a key, you must pick the lock in order to open it.All skills, spells, and other special actions are accessed from the radial menu.  To open the chest you will need to access your open lock skill from the radial menu and then select the chest.  Here is how this is accomplished.-Right-clicking brings up the radial menu. -Hovering over the spokes of the radial menu reveals a new level from which to choose.-Hover over the skills tab (looks like a hammer and an anvil) and then left-click on the skill "open lock".  This will close the radial menu.-Left-click on the chest again and the player will begin trying to pick the lock.A floating message will appear above the chest displaying either your success or failure at picking the lock.  You may not always get it on your first try.  If you have the skill necessary, just keep trying and eventually you will. If you have successfully picked the lock, left-clicking on the chest will open the looting interface and will reveal the chest's contents.
TAG_TUT_ROOM1_OVERVIEW	TAG_TUT_ROOT			Area Information	"You come through the entrance of the cave and the floor quickly turns from dirt to slate. The walls transform from natural rock to layered brick and stone.  The air grows heavier with every step you take.  There is no question that evil lurks here."
TAG_TUT_ROOM2_OVERVIEW	TAG_TUT_ROOT			Area Information	"You enter the room and notice a chest against the wall!  You are surprised to see this chest is in such good repair.  You also notice a sturdy door to the northeast, also appearing in much better condition than the walls surrounding it."
TAG_TUT_ROOM3_OVERVIEW	TAG_TUT_ROOT			Area Information	"Just as you round the corner you see a giant rat in the next room!  The creature seems thin and malnourished, even from this distance.  Even though he may not be at full strength, his size and hunger might make him a serious threat."
TAG_TUT_ROOM4_OVERVIEW	TAG_TUT_ROOT			Area Information	"You notice a well of some sort in the center of the room.  Leaning against the interior wall of the well you can make out the tip of a ladder."
TAG_TUT_ROOM5_OVERVIEW	TAG_TUT_ROOT			Area Information	"You notice a well of some sort in the center of the room.  Leaning against the interior wall of the well you can make out the tip of a ladder."
TAG_TUT_ROOM6_OVERVIEW	TAG_TUT_ROOT			Area Information	"You see another well and ladder leading even deeper into the earth.  The air coming from the well is heavy with moisture and the smell of rotting flesh."
TAG_TUT_ROOM7_OVERVIEW	TAG_TUT_ROOT			Area Information	"Just as you step off the ladder you see something in the next room.  Even through the dim torchlight, you can make out three creatures with muscle and bone protruding from rotting holes in their skin.  They are tearing furiously at a corpse in front of them."
TAG_TUT_LOCKED_DOOR_REMINDER	TAG_TUT_ROOT			Locked Door Information	"This door is locked.  The lock looks much too complex to pick; a key will be necessary to get through."
TAG_TUT_CAST_SPELLS_MAGIC_MISSILE	TAG_TUT_ROOT			Tutorial: Casting Magic Missile	You are now in spell casting mode!  Some spells can have multiple targets, such as Magic Missile, so you will need to select as many targets as your cursor indicates before the spell will be cast. For example, you can left-click on more than one zombie, and designate magic missiles for each of them!  A number will appear on your target when you left-click on them.  This lets you know how many missiles this target will be receiving.  Ariel can cast two missiles simultaneously.  Since there are three zombies, do the following:-Left-click on one zombie.-Left click on a different zombie.Once both of Ariel's missiles have been assigned targets, the spell will automatically fire off!
TAG_TUT_ROOM8_OVERVIEW	TAG_TUT_ROOT			Tutorial: Attack!	Now take your fighter and rush in to finish them off!
TAG_TUT_LOOT_PREFERENCE	TAG_TUT_ROOT			Tutorial: Looting Preference	You have found a Wand of Fireballs!  This is a very powerful item and can be used to damage many targets at once.  It is important to know that some items work best  for different classes.  For instance, a sorcerer wearing plate armor will suffer severe penalties when casting spells.  Plate armor would be best for a barbarian because he isn't concerned with casting spells.Your fighter will most likely fail to use the wand correctly.  The wand should definitely go to Ariel.To put an item in any character's inventory is easy.  Left-click and hold to grab the item and move it over one of your player's portraits along the bottom of the screen.  Simply let go and the item will appear in his/her inventory.You can switch between players when the inventory screen is active by selecting different player portraits.
TAG_TUT_LOOT_REMINDER	TAG_TUT_ROOT			Tutorial: Looting Reminder	Now that the zombies are dead, remember to loot their bodies!  There might be items you need for the next encounter.
TAG_TUT_ROOM9_OVERVIEW	TAG_TUT_ROOT			Area Information	"The groaning and shuffling of a large group of zombies can be heard from the room ahead.  The smell is almost unbearable.  Silhouetting the undead figures is a blazing red light coming from just beyond."
TAG_TUT_WAND_USE	TAG_TUT_ROOT			Tutorial: Using a Wand	This large group of zombies presents a perfect opportunity to have Ariel use the Wand of Fireballs.  Fireball is a spell that deals a large amount of damage to any creature caught in its area of effect.To have Ariel use the wand on the zombies, make sure she alone is selected  by left-clicking on her.  Then access the wand from the radial menu by doing the following:-Right-click  and hover over the inventory tab to reveal all useable objects.-Left-click on the Wand of Fireballs.
TAG_TUT_WAND_FIRE	TAG_TUT_ROOT			Tutorial: Targeting and Firing the Wand	You now have a large, blue, circular targeting reticle attached to your cursor.  If you move your mouse over the room the zombies are in, you will see an effect ring appear around every zombie within the circular sphere of influence.  This is indicating who will be affected by the spell if it cast in this location.  Make sure that you and Ariel are not within the circle or you will take damage as well!Try to get as many of the zombies in the circle as you can and then left-click to fire the spell!After the wand does its damage, use what you have learned to destroy the rest of the zombies!
TAG_TUT_ARIEL_KILL	TAG_TUT_ROOT			Tutorial: You've Killed Ariel!	Ariel is an extremely helpful spellcaster.  By killing her, you have made it extremely difficult to fight through the rest of this dungeon.  We suggest you begin again, but you may continue on and see how far you can get!
TAG_TUT_LOOT_PREFERENCE_ARIEL_DEAD	TAG_TUT_ROOT			Tutorial:  Looting Preference	You have found a Wand of Fireballs!  This is a very powerful item and can be used to damage many targets at once.  It is important to know that some items work best for different classes.  For instance, a sorcerer wearing plate armor will suffer severe penalties when casting spells.  Plate armor would be best for a barbarian because he isn't concerned with casting spells.In the case of wands, fighters are not able to use them at all.  Only if you had a spellcaster with you could you use this extremely powerful item.
TAG_TUT_REST_CAMP_ARIEL_DEAD	TAG_TUT_ROOT			Tutorial: Rest/Camp	Look at the utility bar in the lower right hand corner of the game screen. There is an icon that looks like a tent.  This is the rest icon.  Clicking on this will bring up the rest interface.  Resting will allow you to regain your health, memorize spells, or just let time pass.  You can choose to rest for any amount of time.The rest icon changes colors to indicate if resting is possible or not.  Red means you cannot rest here.  Yellow means you may rest here, but it is dangerous and you might get attacked while you are sleeping.  Green means that this is a safe place and you may rest for any amount of time.Sometimes the rest icon will change from a tent to a stop-watch.  The stop-watch icon indicates that you can only pass-time here.  While passing time you will not regain spells or health, but you will not get attacked either.If you have taken any damage from combat, it is good to rest and regain your health.  Here is how to accomplish this:-Left-Click the rest icon.-It is automatically set to 8 hours, but you want to select the "rest until healed" option.-Click "rest" to begin.
TAG_CRAFT_MAGIC_ARMS_ARMOR_POPUP	TAG_DUMMY			Craft Magic Arms and Armor PopUp	You need to have a masterwork item in order to use Craft Magic Arms and Armor.
TAG_ANIMATED	TAG_DUMMY			Animated	An animated shield floats within 2 feet of the wielder, protecting her as if she were using it herself but freeing up both her hands. Only one shield can protect a character at a time.Prerequisites:CL 12th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, Price +2 bonus
TAG_ARROW_DEFLECTION	TAG_DUMMY			Arrow Deflection	This shield protects the wielder as if he had the Deflect Arrows feat. Once per round when he would normally be struck by a ranged weapon, he can made a DC 20 Reflex save. If the ranged weapon has an enhancement bonus, the DC increases by that amount. If he succeeds, the shield deflects the weapon. He must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed. Attempting to deflect a ranged weapon doesn't count as an action. Exceptional ranged weapons, such as boulders hurled by giants or Melf's acid arrows, can't be deflected.Prerequisites:CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor; Shield; Price +2 bonus.
TAG_BASHING	TAG_DUMMY			Bashing	A shield with this special ability is designed to perform a shield bash. A bashing shield deals damage as if it were a weapon of two size categories larger (a Medium light shield thus deals 1d6 points of damage and a Medium heavy shield deals 1d8 points of damage). The shield acts as a +1 weapon when used to bash. (Only light and heavy shields can have this ability).Prerequisites:CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor; Searing Light; Price +1 bonus.
TAG_DARKWOOD	TAG_DUMMY			Darkwood	This rare magic wood is as hard as normal wood but very light.  Any wooden or mostly wooden item (such as a bow, an arrow, or a spear) made from darkwood is considered a ~masterwork~[TAG_MASTERWORK] item and weighs only half as much as a normal wooden item of that type.  Items not normally made of wood or only partially of wood (such as a battleaxe or a mace) either cannot be made from darkwood or do not gain any special benefit from being made of darkwood.  The armor check penalty of a darkwood shield is lessened by 2 compared to an ordinary shield of its type.Prerequisites:Wooden; Price: To determine the price of a darkwood item, use the original weight but add 10 gp per pound to the price of a masterwork version of that item.
TAG_FORTIFICATION_LIGHT	TAG_DUMMY			Fortification, Light	This suit of armor or shield produces a magical force that protects vital areas of the wearer more effectively. When a critical hit or sneak attack is scored on the wearer, there is a chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and damage is instead rolled normally.Fortification Type   Chance for Normal Damage   Base Price ModifierLight                                             25%                                          +1 bonusPrerequisites:CL 13th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor; Price +1 bonus.
TAG_MITHRAL	TAG_DUMMY			Mithral	Mithral is a very rare silvery, glistening metal that is lighter than iron but just as hard.  When worked like steel, it becomes a wonderful material from which to create armor and is occasionally used for other items as well.  Most mithral armors are one category lighter than normal for purposes of movement and other limitations.  Heavy armors are treated as medium, and medium armors are treated as light, but light armors are still treated as light.  ~Spell failure~[TAG_ARCANE_SPELL_FAILURE] chances for armors and shields made from mithral are decreased by 10%, maximum ~dexterity~[TAG_DEXTERITY] bonus is increased by 2, and armor check penalties are lessened by 3 (to a minimum of 0).  An item made from mithral weighs half as much as the same item made from other metals.  In the case of weapons, this lighter weight does not change a weapon's size category or the ease with which it can be wielded (whether it is light, one-handed, or two-handed).  Items not primarily of metal are not meaningfully affected by being partially made of mithral.  (A longsword can be a mithral weapon, while a scythe cannot be.)  Weapons or armors fashioned from mithral are always ~masterwork~[TAG_MASTERWORK] items as well; the masterwork cost is included in the prices given below.Prerequisites:Metallic; Price: Light Armor - +1,000 gp, Medium Armor - +4,000 gp, Heavy Armor - +9,000 gp, Shield - +1,000 gp, Other Items - +500 gp/lb. 
TAG_SHADOW	TAG_DUMMY			Shadow	This armor is jet black and blurs the wearer whenever he tries to hide, granting a +5 competence bonus on Hide checks. (The armor's AC penalty still applies normally).Prerequisites:CL 5th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor; Invisibility; Price +15,000 gp.
TAG_SILENT_MOVES	TAG_DUMMY			Silent Moves	This armor is well oiled and magically constructed so that it not only makes little sound, but it dampens sound around it. It provides a +5 competence bonus on its wearer's ~Move Silently~[TAG_MOVE_SILENTLY] checks. (The armor's ~AC~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS] penalty still applies normally.)Prerequisites:~Craft Magic Arms and Armor~[TAG_CRAFT_MAA]; Price +15,000 gp.
TAG_SLICK	TAG_DUMMY			Slick	Slick armor seems coated at all times with a slightly greasy oil. It provides a +5 competence bonus on its wearer's Escape Artist check. (The armor's AC penalty still applies normally.)Prerequisites:CL 4th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor; Grease; Price +3, 750 gp.
TAG_MAGIC_ARMOR_SPELL_RESISTANCE	TAG_DUMMY			Magic Armor: Spell Resistance	This property grants the armor's wearer ~spell resistance~[TAG_SPECIAL_ABILITIES_SPELL_RESISTANCE] while the armor is worn. The spell resistance can only be 13.Prerequisites:~Craft Magic Arms and Armor~[TAG_CRAFT_MAA]; ~Spell Resistance~[TAG_SPELLS_SPELL_RESISTANCE]; Price +2 bonus (SR 13).
TAG_ADAMANTINE	TAG_DUMMY			Adamantine	This ultrahard metal adds to the quality of a weapon or suit of armor.  Weapons fashioned from adamantine have a natural ability to bypass hardness when attacking objects, ignoring hardness less than 20.  Armor made from adamantine grants its wearer ~damage reduction~[TAG_SPECIAL_ABILITIES_DAMAGE_REDUCTION] of 1/- if it's light armor, 2/- if it's medium armor, and 3/- if it's heavy armor.  Adamantine is so costly that weapons and armor made from it are always of ~masterwork~[TAG_MASTERWORK] quality; the masterwork cost is included in the prices given below.  Thus, adamantine weapons and ammunition have a +1 ~enhancement~[TAG_ENHANCEMENT_BONUS] bonus on ~attack rolls~[TAG_ATTACK_ROLL] and the armor check penalty of adamantine armor is lessened by 1 compared to ordinary armor of its type.  Items without metal parts cannot be made from adamantine.  An arrow could be made of adamantine, but a quarterstaff could not.Prerequisites:Metallic; Price: Weapon - +3,000 gp, Ammunition - +60 gp, Light Armor - +5,000 gp, Medium Armor - +10,000 gp, Heavy Armor - +15,000 gp, Shield - +2,000 gp.
TAG_ANARCHIC	TAG_DUMMY			Anarchic	An anarchic weapon is chaotically aligned and infused with the power of chaos. It makes the weapon chaos-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damage reduction. It deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against all lawful alignments. It bestows one negative level on any lawful creature attempting to wield it. The negative level remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded. This negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way (including Restoration spells) while the weapon is wielded. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the chaotic power upon their ammunition.Prerequisites:CL 7th; ~Craft Magic Arms and Armor~[TAG_CRAFT_MAA]; ~Chaos Hammer~[TAG_SPELLS_CHAOS_HAMMER]; creator must be chaotic; Price +2 bonus.
TAG_AXIOMATIC	TAG_DUMMY			Axiomatic	An axiomatic weapon is lawfully aligned and infused with the power of law. It makes the weapon law-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damage reduction. It deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against all of chaotic alignment. It bestows one negative level on any chaotic creature attempting to wield it. The negative level remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded. This negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way (including Restoration spells) while the weapon is wielded. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the lawful power upon their ammunition.Prerequisites:CL 7th; ~Craft Magic Arms and Armor~[TAG_CRAFT_MAA]; ~Order's Wrath~[TAG_SPELLS_ORDER'S_WRATH]; creator must be lawful; Price +2 bonus.
TAG_DEFENDING	TAG_DUMMY			Defending	A defending weapon allows the wielder to transfer some or all of the weapon's ~enhancement~[TAG_ENHANCEMENT_BONUS] bonus to his ~AC~[TAG_ARMOR_CLASS] as a bonus that stacks with all others. As a ~free action~[TAG_FREE_ACTION], the wielder chooses how to allocate the weapon's enhancement bonus at the start of his turn before using the weapon, and the effect to AC lasts until his next turn.Prerequisites:CL 8th; ~Craft Magic Arms and Armor~[TAG_CRAFT_MAA], ~Shield~[TAG_SPELLS_SHIELD] or ~Shield of Faith~[TAG_SPELLS_SHIELD_OF_FAITH]; Price +1 bonus.
TAG_FLAMING	TAG_DUMMY			Flaming	A flaming weapon is sheathed in fire. The fire does harm the wielder. The effect remains until another command is given. A flaming weapon deals an extra 1d6 points of fire damage on a successful hit. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the fire energy upon their ammunition.Prerequisites:CL 10th; ~Craft Magic Arms and Armor~[TAG_CRAFT_MAA]; ~Flame Strike~[TAG_SPELLS_FLAME_STRIKE] or ~Fireball~[TAG_SPELLS_FIREBALL]; Price +1 bonus.
TAG_FLAMING_BURST	TAG_DUMMY			Flaming Burst	A flaming burst weapon functions as a flaming weapon that also explodes with flame upon striking a successful ~critical hit~[TAG_CRITICAL_HIT]. The fire does not harm the wielder. In addition to the extra fire damage from the flaming ability, a flaming burst weapon deals an extra 1d10 points of fire damage on a successful critical hit. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the fire energy upon their ammunition.

TAG_HOLY	TAG_DUMMY			Holy	A holy weapon is imbued with holy power. This power makes the weapon good-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damage reduction. It deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against all of evil alignment. It bestows one negative level on any evil creature attempting to wield it.

For instance, if it is placed on a ~longsword~[TAG_WEAPONS_LONGSWORD] (which has a normal threat range of 19-20), the keen longsword scores a threat on a 17-20. Only piercing or slashing weapons can be keen. This benefit doesn't stack with any other magical effect that expands the threat range of a weapon (such as the ~Keen Edge~[TAG_SPELLS_KEEN_EDGE] spell or the ~Improved Critical~[TAG_IMPROVED_CRITICAL] feat).Prerequisites:CL 10th; ~Craft Magic Arms and Armor~[TAG_CRAFT_MAA]; Keen Edge; Price +1 bonus.

TAG_SILVER	TAG_DUMMY			Silver, Alchemical	A complex process involving metallurgy and alchemy can bond silver to a weapon made of metal so that it bypasses the ~damage reduction~[TAG_SPECIAL_ABILITIES_DAMAGE_REDUCTION] of creatures, such as lycanthropes.  The alchemical silvering process can't be applied to nonmetal items and it doesn't work on rare metals such as ~adamantine~[TAG_ADAMANTINE] or ~mithral~[TAG_MITHRAL].Prerequisites:Metallic; Price: Two-Handed Weapon - +180 gp, One-Handed Weapon - +90 gp, Light Weapon - +20 gp, Ammunition - +2 gp.

The negative level remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded. This negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way (including Restoration spells) while the weapon is wielded. Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow the unholy power upon their ammunition.Prerequisites:CL 7th; ~Craft Magic Arms and Armor~[TAG_CRAFT_MAA]; ~Unholy Blight~[TAG_SPELLS_UNHOLY_BLIGHT]; creator must be evil; Price +2 bonus.

TAG_HMU_OPTIONS_UI_CONCURRENT_TURNS	TAG_HMU_OPTIONS_UI			Concurrent Turn Options	If this option is enabled, monsters who are able to take turns at the same time will do so. Enabling this option speeds up combat, but may subtlely change certain events.  For example, if you have the combat reflexes feat,  you may not be able to take an ~attack of opportunity~[TAG_AOO] against a second opponent.  Also, if two monsters move into flanking position both may get the bonus while if concurrent turns were disabled only one would get the bonus.
TAG_HMU_OPTIONS_UI_END_TURN_TIME	TAG_HMU_OPTIONS_UI			End Turn with Time Remaining	This option can be enabled in order to speed up combat.Never - If this option is selected, you will have to end each character's turn manually, either by hitting return or by pressing the red next turn button beneath the action bar.5-foot step - A player's turn will end when the character has only a 5 foot step remaining. Move - A player's turn will end if he's only got a move action remaining.  
TAG_HMU_OPTIONS_UI_END_TURN_DEFAULT	TAG_HMU_OPTIONS_UI			End Turn with Default Action	If this option is enabled, the character's turn will end if he has performed a default attack on an opponent.  A default attack is one performed by just clicking on the opponent as opposed to selecting the attack through the radial menu.

She was confinedamong her own; her very lairbecame her prison and despair.The place was ruined, torn apartand left with chains around the heartof evil power -  but the keywas never found in the debris.He knows not where she dwells today.She set the minions path, the wayto lift her temple high againwith tools of flesh, with mortal men.Many now have gone to diein water, flame, in earth or sky.They did not bear the key of oldthat must be found -  the orb of gold.Beware my friend for you shall fallunless you have the wherewithalto find and search the boxes fourand then escape for evermore.But with the key you might succeedin throwing down her power and greed.Destroy the key when you are doneand then rejoice, the battle won!
TAG_EXTRAPLANAR_NOTE	TAG_DUMMY			Cerulean's Note	Thank you for using Cerulean's Extraplanar Chest.To return the chest to the Ethereal Plane, use the miniature chest again.Before you do, however, there are two things to keep in mind:Firstly, any and all charged magic items (wands, staves, rods, etc.) put into the chest will be unrecoverable once you send the chest to the Ethereal Plane.DO NOT PUT CHARGED ITEMS INTO THIS CHEST.Secondly, any magic arms and armour with crafted attributes will lose those attributes once the chest is sent to the Ethereal Plane.DO NOT PUT CRAFTED ARMS AND ARMOUR INTO THIS CHEST.Magic arms and armour you find will not suffer this effect, unless you have crafted additional attributes onto them.At this time we do not know why this is happening, but we suspect that there are some form of magic devouring creatures on the Ethereal Plane that are responsible.The best course of action is to not put those items in the chest.Once again, thank you for using Cerulean's Extraplanar Chest.

And some might think me crazy, but I'm sure I saw some sort of lizard creature slither by.MOONDAYI don't care for those other two down here. They're positively mischievous.GODSDAYSomeone is coming for me, I can feel it. The children are restless. I must hide them away.WATERDAYSelected a wonderful spot for them beneath some tables and chairs down one of the corridors. Must remember where it is!EARTHDAYI feel dreadful. I've seen those horrible things searching. They jitter and twitch their buggy eyes as they scurry by like the infernal insects they are.FREEDAYThose others told me they want me to stay now, forever, but first I have to go to sleep in a puddle of water. I don't think I want to. Let those beasts come now - I am ready to go home.

TAG_NOTICE_CITY_COUNCIL	TAG_DUMMY			Notice from Verbobonc City Council	Citizens of the Viscounty,It is with the heaviest of hearts that the City Council must announce the destruction of the village of Hommlet. Raiders from a violent and militaristic sect of the evil cult of Hextor descended upon the helpless village and murdered many of the town's inhabitants, pillaged their goods, and by most accounts took many other townsfolk captive.We deeply regret that the local group enlisted to defend the town in lieu of the Regional Patrol failed in their assigned task.The village of Hommlet is deserted and barren now, and we recommend that all citizens avoid it on your travels, as it will no doubt become a haven for bandits, vandals, thrillseekers, and other lowly men and women of their ilk.Our deepest condolences to the families of the lost,The Verbobonc City Council

TAG_NOTICE_ASAPH	TAG_DUMMY			Notice from Captain Asaph	Dear friend and citizen,We have never met, but this writing is from Captain Asaph, commander of the Verbobonc Regional Patrol. I am in need of a private force to investigate some possible resumed illegal activity at the Moathouse, and I have been told that you are good in a pinch, shall we say. I believe you are familiar with this location? We have received reports of strange goings on in the area from nearby villages and travelers, with the assumption being that another group of bandits has taken up residence. Please go root them out, as the Regional Patrol cannot spare any troops at this time.All the best,Captain AsaphVerbobonc Constabulary
TAG_NOTICE_ASAPH_2	TAG_DUMMY			Notice from Captain Asaph	Good friend,My sources tell me that the trouble at the Moathouse - whatever it was - is ended. Thank you so much for taking care of this for our great viscounty.I petitioned the city council on your behalf for reward money, but unfortunately I'm told the viscounty cannot allocate any resources to that end at this time.You have my deepest gratitude nonetheless,Captain AsaphVerbobonc Constabulary
TAG_NOTICE_ASAPH_3	TAG_DUMMY			Notice from Captain Asaph	My good friend,Please be so kind as to be on the lookout for an officer of ours who has gone missing, one Lieutenant Bethany Sadonius.Lieutenant Sadonius is a ranger who is assigned to reconnaissance work in the Kron Hills area.

A few days ago she failed to report back to us on her whereabouts via courier as per normal procedure, this after having advised that she was tracking a pack of orcs or some such.If you should happen to run across her, please send her back to her post in Verbobonc. Poor Corporal Holly is worried about her.The lieutenant is a bit of a firebrand, but she's harmless enough.Best wishes,Captain AsaphVerbobonc Constabulary
